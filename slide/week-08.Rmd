# Chapter 7 Learning Objectives

1. Identify the types of research questions and hypotheses used in a quantitative study.

2. Learn how to write a good qualitative central question and sub-question.

3. Describe how to craft a mixed methods question describing the intent and procedures for a mixed methods study.

---

# Introduction

* Placing signposts for the reader
  * Purpose statement
  * Research questions or hypotheses
* Research questions narrow the purpose statement
  * Quantitative research questions and hypotheses
  * Qualitative research questions
  * Mixed methods research questions

---

# Quantitative Research Questions and Hypotheses (1 of 8)

* Quantitative research questions
  * About the relationships among variables that the investigator seeks to know
* Quantitative hypotheses
  * Predictions about the expected relationships among variables
  * Estimates of population values based on data from a sample

---

* Quantitative objectives
  * Indicate a study's goals
  * Often in proposals for funding, less common in health and social sciences

---

Quantitative research question describing outcomes:

What is the frequency and variation of scores on ____________ (name the variable) for ______________(participants) in the study?

---

Quantitative research question focused on examining the relationship among variables:

_________ (name the theory) posits that _____ (explain relationships between variables). It is thus predicted that there will be a relationship between ________ (predictor variable) and ________ (outcome variable), such that (explain the direction of the effect between the predictor and outcome variable).

---

Quantitative null hypothesis:

There is no significant difference between _________ (the control and experimental groups on the independent variable) on _________ (dependent variable).

---

* Three basic approaches
  * Compare groups
  * Relate variables
  * Describe responses
* Most rigorous form tests a theory
* Measure the independent and dependent variables separately
* Write questions or hypotheses
* Null and alternative hypotheses

---

* The use of variables in research questions or hypothesis if one wants to do
  * An experiment or group comparisons
  * A survey that correlates variables
  * A descriptive study

---

* If writing hypotheses, use a consistent form
  * Null hypotheses (predict no difference or no relationship)
  * Alternative hypothesis (predict significant relationship between variables)
  * Use directional words of quantitative research:
    * Affect, influence, predict, impact, determine, cause, and relate

---

# Qualitative Research Questions (1 of 6)

* Qualitative researchers pose research questions
  * Not objectives
  * Not hypotheses
* Two forms of qualitative research questions
  * Central question
    * Broad question that asks for exploration of the central phenomenon
  * Sub-questions
    * Questions that narrow the focus of the study

---

* Ask 1‚Äì2 central research questions
  * Broad and ask for exploration of the central phenomenon or concept
  * Explore the general, complex factors about to the central phenomenon
  * Present broad perspectives or meanings

---

* No more than 5‚Äì7 sub-questions these will narrow the focus but leave open the questioning
* Relate the central question to the strategy of inquiry
  * Ethnography ‚Äì culture sharing group, questions verify accuracy of data
  * Critical ethnography ‚Äì build on an existing literature
  * Phenomenology ‚Äì what participants experienced
  * Grounded theory ‚Äì generate a theory

---

Begin with ‚Äúwhat‚Äù or ‚Äúhow‚Äù to convey an open or emerging design

Focus on a single phenomenon or concept

Use exploratory verbs: report, describe, discover, seek, explore, describe

---

Expect questions to evolve and change

Use open-ended questions without reference to the literature or theory (unless indicated)

Specify the participants and research site

---

_________ (How or what?) is the _________ (central phenomenon) for _________ (participants) at _________ (research site).

---

# Mixed Methods Research Questions and Hypotheses (1 of 3)

Include qualitative, quantitative (or hypotheses), and a mixed methods research question

Qualitative and quantitative questions focus the purpose

Mixed methods question conveys the importance of integrating

Use guidelines for qualitative and quantitative questions and hypotheses

---

* Order questions to match the mixed methods design
  * In a single-phase design, either first
  * In a two-phase design, order to match the phases
  * In three-phase, often mixed methods in the middle

---

A  __mixed methods research question __ directly addresses integration

Mixed methods question:

The mixed methods question in the study purpose or  _intent _ will be to ________ (compare, explain, build, augment) the ________ (quantitative data or qualitative data or process/framework) with ________ (quantitative data or qualitative data) by using a ________ (design: convergent design, explanatory sequential design, exploratory sequential design, embedded design) with the  _procedure _ of ________ (merging, connecting, or embedding).

---

# Summary

Research questions and hypotheses narrow the purpose statement and add signposts

Qualitative ‚Äì central question and sub-questions

Quantitative ‚Äì describe, related, compare variables

Mixed methods ‚Äì qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods question
