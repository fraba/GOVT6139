## Understanding Variable Types

### Three Variable Types in JASP

JASP uses **symbols** in column headers to show variable type:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Scale** | Continuous numerical data | Age, Height, Income |
| **Ordinal** | Ordered categories | Education level (1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High) |
| **Nominal** | Unordered categories | Gender, Color, Country |

**IMPORTANT:**
- JASP guesses variable types when loading data
- **It may guess wrong!**
- **You must check and fix variable types**

**Why it matters:**
- Wrong variable type ‚Üí Wrong analysis options ‚Üí Wrong results!

---

## Changing Variable Types

### How to Fix Variable Types

.pull-left[

**Two Methods:**

**Method 1: Click the Icon**
1. Click the symbol in the column header
2. Select the correct type from dropdown
3. Done!

**Method 2: Use the Variable Editor**
1. Double-click the column header
2. Change measurement level
3. Can also add labels here

]

.pull-right[

**Important Tips:**
- **IDs should be Nominal** (even if numbers)
- **Likert scales can be Ordinal or Scale** (your choice)
- **Binary variables (0/1) should be Nominal**
- **Age is Scale** (continuous numbers)

]



---

## Slide 7: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 1
### Loading the Titanic Dataset

**Your Task:**

1. **Download** the file `titanic.csv` from the course materials
2. **Open JASP** on your computer
3. **Load the data:**
   - File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Computer ‚Üí Browse
   - Find `titanic.csv` and open it

4. **Examine the data:**
   - How many rows (passengers)?
   - How many columns (variables)?
   - What variables do you see?

**Take 2 minutes**

**Expected:** 891 rows, 12 columns

---

## Slide 8: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 2
### Identifying &amp; Fixing Variable Types

**The Titanic Dataset Variables:**

Look at your data and identify which type each variable should be:

| Variable | Current Type? | Should Be? |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| PassengerId | ? | ? |
| Survived | ? | ? |
| Pclass | ? | ? |
| Name | ? | ? |
| Sex | ? | ? |
| Age | ? | ? |
| Fare | ? | ? |

**Your Task:**
1. Check what type JASP assigned to each variable
2. Decide what type each should be
3. Fix any incorrect types by clicking the icon

**Take 3 minutes**

---

## Slide 9: üéØ EXERCISE 2 - SOLUTION

### Correct Variable Types for Titanic

| Variable | Should Be | Why? |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **PassengerId** | **Nominal** | ID number (not meaningful numerically) |
| **Survived** | **Nominal** | Binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes |
| **Pclass** | **Nominal** or **Ordinal** | Ticket class: 1, 2, 3 (categories) |
| **Name** | **Nominal** | Text label (categorical) |
| **Sex** | **Nominal** | male or female (categorical) |
| **Age** | **Scale** | Continuous number (0-80 years) |
| **Fare** | **Scale** | Continuous number (price paid) |

**Key Decisions:**
- **Survived**: Could be ordinal, but typically treated as nominal for chi-square tests
- **Pclass**: Could be ordinal (ordered categories) or nominal‚Äîboth work!

---

## Slide 10: What Are Descriptive Statistics?

### Summarizing Your Data

**Descriptive statistics** help you understand your data by providing:

**For Continuous Variables (Scale):**
- **Central tendency:** Where is the "middle"?
  - Mean, Median, Mode
- **Spread:** How spread out are the values?
  - Standard deviation, Variance, Range
  - Minimum, Maximum, Quartiles

**For Categorical Variables (Nominal/Ordinal):**
- **Frequencies:** How many in each category?
  - Counts and percentages

**Why Use Them?**
- Understand your data before analysis
- Spot errors and outliers
- Describe your sample in reports

---

## Slide 11: Measures of Central Tendency

### Finding the "Middle" of Your Data

**Three Main Measures:**

**1. Mean (Average)**
- Sum of all values √∑ number of values
- Most commonly used
- Sensitive to outliers
- Example: Ages = 20, 25, 30, 35, 100 ‚Üí Mean = 42

**2. Median**
- Middle value when data is sorted
- Robust to outliers
- Example: Ages = 20, 25, **30**, 35, 100 ‚Üí Median = 30

**3. Mode**
- Most frequently occurring value
- Can be used for any variable type
- Example: Ages = 20, 25, 25, 25, 30 ‚Üí Mode = 25

**Which to use?**
- **Normally distributed data** ‚Üí Mean
- **Skewed data or outliers** ‚Üí Median
- **Categorical data** ‚Üí Mode

---

## Slide 12: Measures of Spread

### How Variable Is Your Data?

**Common Measures:**

**1. Standard Deviation (SD)**
- Average distance from the mean
- Most commonly reported
- Same units as your data
- Larger SD = more spread out

**2. Variance**
- Squared standard deviation
- Less intuitive but used in calculations

**3. Range**
- Maximum - Minimum
- Shows full spread

**4. Interquartile Range (IQR)**
- Range of middle 50% of data
- 75th percentile - 25th percentile
- Robust to outliers

---

## Slide 13: Computing Descriptives in JASP

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Steps:**

1. **Open the Analysis Menu:**
   - Click **Descriptives** button (top menu bar)
   - Select **Descriptive Statistics**

2. **Select Variables:**
   - Drag variables from left box to **Variables** box
   - OR click variable and use arrow button

3. **Choose Statistics:**
   - Under **Statistics**, check boxes for what you want:
     - ‚òë Mean
     - ‚òë Median
     - ‚òë Std. Deviation
     - ‚òë Minimum / Maximum
     - etc.

4. **View Results:**
   - Results appear immediately in right panel
   - Update in real-time as you change options

---

## Slide 14: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 3
### Descriptive Statistics for Age

**Your Task:**

Calculate descriptive statistics for the **Age** variable:

   - ‚òë Maximum
   - ‚òë Range

**Questions to Answer:**
- What is the average age of Titanic passengers?
- What is the median age?
- What is the youngest age? Oldest?
- Is the mean or median higher? What does this tell us?

**Take 3 minutes**

---

## Slide 15: üéØ EXERCISE 3 - DISCUSSION

### Interpreting Age Statistics

**Expected Results (approximately):**

| Statistic | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Mean** | ~29.7 | Average age around 30 years |
| **Median** | ~28.0 | Middle age is 28 |
| **SD** | ~14.5 | Typical deviation is ¬±14-15 years |
| **Min** | ~0.42 | Youngest passenger was an infant |
| **Max** | ~80 | Oldest was 80 years old |
| **Range** | ~80 | Ages span 80 years |

**Observations:**
- Mean &gt; Median ‚Üí Slight **positive skew** (right tail)
- Some older passengers pull the mean up
- Large SD indicates substantial age variation
- Note: Some ages are missing (Missing = 177)

---

## Slide 16: Frequency Tables for Categorical Data

### Counting Categories

**For Nominal/Ordinal Variables:**

**Frequency tables show:**
- Count in each category
- Percentage in each category
- Cumulative percentages (for ordinal)

**How to Create in JASP:**

1. **Descriptives** ‚Üí **Descriptive Statistics**
2. Move categorical variable to **Variables** box
3. Under **Statistics**, check:
   - ‚òë **Frequency tables (nominal and ordinal variables)**

**Result:**
- Table showing counts and percentages
- Helps understand distribution of categories

---

## Slide 17: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 4
### Frequency Tables for Survival &amp; Sex

**Part A: Survival Status**

1. Create a frequency table for **Survived**
2. Answer:
   - How many passengers survived?
   - How many died?
   - What percentage survived?

**Part B: Sex Distribution**

3. Create a frequency table for **Sex**
4. Answer:
   - How many males vs females?
   - What percentage were male?

**Part C: Passenger Class**

5. Create a frequency table for **Pclass**
6. Answer:
   - Which class had the most passengers?
   - What's the distribution across classes?

**Take 5 minutes**

---

## Slide 18: üéØ EXERCISE 4 - EXPECTED RESULTS

### Frequency Table Solutions

**Survived:**
| Value | Count | Percent |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 (No) | 549 | 61.6% |
| 1 (Yes) | 342 | 38.4% |

**Sex:**
| Value | Count | Percent |
|-------|-------|---------|
| male | 577 | 64.8% |
| female | 314 | 35.2% |

**Pclass:**
| Value | Count | Percent |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 (First) | 216 | 24.2% |
| 2 (Second) | 184 | 20.7% |
| 3 (Third) | 491 | 55.1% |

**Insights:**
- Most passengers died (61.6%)
- More males than females (about 2:1)
- Most passengers were in 3rd class (55%)

---

## Slide 19: Visualizing Distributions

### Adding Plots to Descriptives

**JASP makes it easy to visualize your data!**

**For Scale Variables:**

Under **Plots** in Descriptive Statistics:
- ‚òë **Distribution plots** ‚Üí Histogram
- ‚òë **Display density** ‚Üí Smooth curve overlay
- ‚òë **Boxplots** ‚Üí Shows median, quartiles, outliers

**Benefits:**
- **Histograms:** See shape of distribution
- **Density plots:** Smooth distribution curve
- **Boxplots:** Quick summary with outliers

**For Categorical Variables:**
- Frequency tables are often sufficient
- Bar charts can be created elsewhere in JASP

---

## Slide 20: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 5
### Visualizing Age Distribution

**Your Task:**

Create visualizations for the **Age** variable:

1. Keep Age in the **Variables** box
2. Under **Plots**, check:
   - ‚òë **Distribution plots**
   - ‚òë **Display density**
   - ‚òë **Boxplots**

**Observe and Discuss:**
- What shape is the distribution?
- Is it symmetric or skewed?
- Where is the peak?
- Are there any outliers?
- What does the boxplot tell you about the median and quartiles?

**Take 3 minutes**

---

## Slide 21: Reading a Histogram

### Understanding Distribution Plots

**What to Look For:**

**Shape:**
- **Symmetric** (bell-shaped) ‚Üí Normal distribution
- **Right skewed** (long right tail) ‚Üí Most values on left
- **Left skewed** (long left tail) ‚Üí Most values on right
- **Bimodal** (two peaks) ‚Üí Two subgroups?

**Center:**
- Where is the peak (mode)?
- Is it where you expected?

**Spread:**
- How wide is the distribution?
- Are values clustered or dispersed?

**Age Distribution:**
- Slightly right skewed (mean &gt; median)
- Peak around 20-30 years
- Reasonable spread across ages

---

## Slide 22: Reading a Boxplot

### Understanding Box-and-Whisker Plots

**Anatomy of a Boxplot:**

```
    ‚óè  ‚Üê Outlier (beyond 1.5 √ó IQR)
    |
    ‚î¨  ‚Üê Maximum (within 1.5 √ó IQR)
    |
    ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÇ ‚Üê Median (thick line)
    ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº
    |
    ‚î¥  ‚Üê Minimum (within 1.5 √ó IQR)
    |
    ‚óè  ‚Üê Outlier
```

**Box:** Contains middle 50% of data (25th to 75th percentile)
**Whiskers:** Extend to most extreme non-outlier values
**Dots:** Outliers beyond 1.5 √ó IQR

**Quick Assessment:**
- Symmetric box ‚Üí Symmetric distribution
- Long upper whisker ‚Üí Right skew
- Dots ‚Üí Potential outliers to investigate

---

## Slide 23: Grouped Descriptive Statistics

### Comparing Groups

**What if we want to compare subgroups?**

**Example:** Age statistics separately for males and females

**How to Do It:**

1. **Descriptives** ‚Üí **Descriptive Statistics**
2. Move continuous variable (Age) to **Variables**
3. Move grouping variable (Sex) to **Split** box
4. Select desired statistics

**Result:**
- Separate statistics for each group
- Easy comparison across groups
- Can also split plots!

**This is useful for:**
- Comparing survivors vs non-survivors
- Comparing passenger classes
- Any categorical breakdown

---

## Slide 24: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 6
### Comparing Age by Survival Status

**Your Task:**

Compare age distributions for survivors vs non-survivors:

1. **Descriptives** ‚Üí **Descriptive Statistics**
2. Move **Age** to **Variables**
3. Move **Survived** to **Split**
4. Check: Mean, Median, SD, Min, Max
5. Under **Plots**, check **Boxplots**

**Questions:**
- Were survivors younger or older on average?
- Is there a difference in median age?
- Do the boxplots show different patterns?
- What does this suggest?

**Take 4 minutes**

---

## Slide 25: üéØ EXERCISE 6 - DISCUSSION

### Age by Survival Status

**Expected Pattern:**

| Survived | Mean Age | Median Age | Observations |
|----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 0 (Died) | ~30.6 | 28 | Slightly older |
| 1 (Survived) | ~28.3 | 28 | Slightly younger |

**Insights:**
- Small difference in mean age
- Similar median ages
- Children may have had better survival rates
- But age alone doesn't tell the whole story!

**Next Steps:**
- These are just descriptive statistics
- To test if differences are **significant**, we need:
  - Chi-square test (for categorical comparisons)
  - t-test (for mean comparisons)
  - More complex analyses

**This is where hypothesis testing comes in!**

---

## Slide 26: Dealing with Missing Data

### What About Missing Values?

**JASP Handles Missing Data Automatically:**

**In the Data:**
- Missing values shown as blank cells
- Or sometimes as "." or "NA"

**In Descriptives:**
- "Missing" count shows how many are missing
- "Valid" count shows how many have data
- Statistics calculated only on valid cases

**Age Variable:**
- 177 passengers have missing ages
- Valid N = 714
- About 20% missing

**Best Practices:**
- Always report missing data
- Check if missing data is random or systematic
- Consider implications for your analysis

---

## Slide 27: üéØ IN-CLASS EXERCISE 7
### Complete Descriptive Analysis

**Your Challenge:**

Perform a complete descriptive analysis of **Fare**:

1. Calculate descriptive statistics:
   - Central tendency (Mean, Median)
   - Spread (SD, Range, IQR)
   - Check for missing values

2. Create visualizations:
   - Histogram with density
   - Boxplot

3. Compare across passenger classes:
   - Split by **Pclass**
   - Compare mean fares

4. Interpret:
   - What is the typical fare?
   - How variable are the fares?
   - Do fares differ by class?

**Take 5-7 minutes**

---

## Slide 28: üéØ EXERCISE 7 - DISCUSSION

### Fare Analysis Insights

**Expected Findings:**

**Overall Statistics:**
- Mean fare: ~¬£32 (but highly skewed!)
- Median fare: ~¬£14 (more representative)
- Huge SD and range (some very expensive tickets)
- Several high-value outliers

**By Passenger Class:**
| Class | Mean Fare | Median Fare |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1st | ~¬£84 | ~¬£60 |
| 2nd | ~¬£21 | ~¬£14 |
| 3rd | ~¬£13 | ~¬£8 |

**Observations:**
- Fare is heavily right-skewed
- Median better than mean (outliers present)
- Clear class differences in ticket prices
- 1st class passengers paid 6x more on average!

---

## Slide 29: Exporting Your Results

### Saving Your Work

**Three Main Options:**

**1. Copy Individual Tables/Plots:**
- Right-click on any result
- Select **Copy** or **Copy Special**
- Paste into Word, PowerPoint, etc.
- Tables are APA-formatted!

**2. Export Data:**

**Pro Tip:** Save as .jasp file regularly to preserve your work!

---

## Slide 30: Best Practices for Descriptive Statistics

### Tips for Success

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Always check variable types first!
- Calculate descriptives before formal tests
- Visualize your data (plots reveal patterns)
- Report both central tendency and spread
- Note missing data
- Use median for skewed distributions
- Compare groups when relevant

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Trust JASP's automatic variable type guessing
- Report only mean without SD
- Ignore outliers without investigation
- Forget to check for missing data
- Over-interpret small differences
- Use mean for highly skewed data

**Remember:** Descriptive statistics are the foundation of all analyses!
