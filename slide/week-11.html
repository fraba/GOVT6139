---

class: segue

# Part 1: Introduction

---

## What is Qualitative Research?

**Core Focus:**
Understanding the **meaning** underlying intentions, actions, objects, or phenomena

**Key Principle:**
Explanation cannot be independent of context

**Questions Answered:**
- **What** is happening? (descriptive)
- **How** did this occur? (process)
- **Why** did this happen? (explanatory)

**Method:**
In-depth analysis through 'thick' description, case studies, or small-N comparisons

---

## Core Characteristics

1. **Participants' meanings** - not researcher's preconceptions
2. **Natural settings** - not laboratories
3. **Researcher as instrument** - direct collection and interpretation
4. **Multiple data sources** - triangulation
5. **Context-dependent** - understanding within specific settings
6. **Textual and verbal focus** - including silences and omissions
7. **Reflexivity** - acknowledging researcher's role and biases

---

## The Approach or Design: Two Options (but one doesn't exclude the other)

.pull-left[

.small[

### **Descriptive Methods**
- Based on everyday language of participants
- Little interpretation from pre-existing theory
- Maximum variation in sampling
- Cataloguing data into themes

### **Analytic Frameworks**
Examples: narrative study, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, case study
- Specific frameworks for data collection and analysis
- Limited variability in application


]

]

.pull-right[

.small[

- Popularised in specific disciplines
- Have philosophical foundations

**When Writing About Your Design:**
1. Identify specific approach with literature references
2. Provide background information about the approach
3. Discuss why it's appropriate for your study
4. Identify how approach will shape your design process

## Research Topics in Political Science
*Applicable to Social Sciences Generally*

**Core Questions:**
- How are societies governed?
- How is power distributed and used?
- How are collective decisions made?
- How do actors interact with institutions?

**Levels of Analysis:**
- Macro: Institutional and structural forces
- Meso: Organisations, groups, movements  
- Micro: Individual engagement and participation

---

## When to Use Qualitative Methods

**Ideal For:**
- Understanding meanings people give to actions
- Exploring processes and "how" questions
- Studying institutions, actors, events in context
- Capturing lived experiences
- Uncovering what's left unsaid
- Identifying causal mechanisms not evident elsewhere

**Can Be Used With:**
- Positivist OR interpretivist epistemologies
- Different purposes depending on research goals

---

class: segue

# Part 2: Generating Data

---

## Three Primary Approaches

**1. Talking to People**
- Interviews (elite and non-elite)
- Focus groups

**2. Collecting Relevant Materials**
- Documents (textual)
- Visual and audio-visual data

**3. Observing with Different Degrees of Involvement**
- Non-participatory observation
- Participatory observation and ethnography

---

## Interviews: Semi-Structured Approach

**Why Use Interviews:**
- Probe individual understandings
- Identify causal mechanisms
- Get insider perspectives
- Capture historical information

**Semi-Structured Format:**
- Clear questions/issues prepared
- Flexible order and coverage
- Allow interview to shape progression
- Appropriate when limited prior knowledge exists

---

## Data Recording: Protocols &amp; Guides

.small[





.pull-left[

**Why Use Protocols?**
- Ensures consistency across data collection
- Prevents forgetting important information
- Helps manage interview anxiety
- Facilitates analysis later

**Interview Protocol Components:**

1. **Header:** Date, time, location, participant code
2. **Introduction:**
   - Introduce yourself
   - Study purpose
   - Get consent signature
   - Explain structure
   - Define key terms

]

.pull-right[

3\. **Content Questions (5-10):**
   - Research sub-questions
   - Space for notes
   - **Probes:** "Tell me more," "Please explain"
   
4\. **Closing Instructions:**
   - Thank participant
   - Assure confidentiality
   - Discuss results sharing
   - Request follow-up if needed

]

]

---

## Collecting Documents: Textual Data

.pull-left[

**Public Documents:**
- Government publications, policy documents
- Parliamentary transcripts
- Meeting minutes, official reports
- Newspapers, media articles

**Private Documents:**
- Personal journals, diaries
- Letters, emails
- Private blogs

]

.pull-right[

**Can Be:**
- Objective sources
- Or objects of analysis themselves (social products/cultural artefacts)

]



---

## Collecting Documents: Visual Data

**Types:**
- Photographs, videos, films
- Paintings, cartoons, graffiti
- Advertisements, posters
- Social media images (memes)
- Art objects, stamps

**Why Important:**
- Frame what can be seen, thought, and said
- Delineate what's politically possible
- Rich sources for understanding ideologies
- Increasingly important in social media age

---

## Photo-Elicitation

**Method:**
Use images to elicit comments and discussion

**Process:**
- Images provided by researcher OR created by participants
- Often combined with interviews or focus groups
- Particularly useful for sensitive/abstract topics

**Example:** Marsh et al. (2006)
- Gave young people various pictures
- Asked to sort into "political" vs "non-political"
- Revealed their understanding without imposing definitions

---

## Observation: Degrees of Involvement

.pull-left[

**Non-Participatory:**
- Avoid intervention in observed situations
- Document context and events
- Capture mundane, everyday experiences

**Participatory:**
- Researcher immerses in what they study
- Active involvement in setting
- Extended time periods

]

.pull-right[

**Ethnography:**
- Understanding culture through immersion
- Participant observation
- Produces "thick description"
- Explores power relationships

]



---

## Ethnography Examples

**Mansbridge (1980)** - Adversary Democracy
- 2+ years observing town hall meetings
- Distinguished unitary vs adversary democracy

**Curato (2019)** - Deliberative Democracy in Disasters
- Ethnography in disaster-affected Philippines
- Revealed creative forms democracy takes

**Zacka (2017)** - Street-Level Bureaucrats
- 8 months as welfare agency receptionist
- Revealed bureaucrats as moral agents with discretion

---

## Reflexivity in Data Generation

**Definition:** Explicit acknowledgment of researcher's value positions and how choices are shaped by values

**Required:**
- Transparency about subject matter choices
- Reflection on research questions
- How and what data is collected
- How analysis and interpretations are shaped
- Interaction with research field

**Purpose:** Ensure research process is transparent and researcher influence is acknowledged

---

## Ethical Considerations in Qualitative Research

.small[

**Why Critical in Qualitative Work? -&gt; Participants' rights, needs, and dignity come FIRST**
- Direct contact with participants
- Often involves vulnerable populations
- Access to sensitive/private information
- Power dynamics between researcher and participants

**Essential Ethical Practices:**

.pull-left[

**Before Research:**
- Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs) approval
- Informed consent
- Access through gatekeepers
- Clear communication of purpose
- Right to withdraw

]

.pull-right[

**During &amp; After:**
- Protect confidentiality/anonymity
- Secure data storage
- Respectful questioning
- Avoid "backyard" research risks
- Share results appropriately
- Credit participants' ownership

]

]

---

## Sampling Strategy: Purposeful &amp; Saturation

**Purposeful Sampling**

**Definition:** Intentionally selecting participants/sites that will best help understand the phenomenon

**Not:** Random sampling or large numbers (as in quantitative research)

**Consider:**
- **Setting** - Where will research take place?
- **Actors** - Who will be observed/interviewed?
- **Events** - What will actors be doing?
- **Process** - How do events unfold?

---

.pull-left[

**Sample Size Guidelines:**
- Narrative: 1-2 individuals
- Phenomenology: 3-10
- Grounded Theory: 20-30
- Ethnography: 1 group + artifacts
- Case Study: 4-5 cases
- Descriptive Method: 20+

]

.pull-right[

**Saturation (from Grounded Theory)**

**Definition:** Stop collecting data when:
- No new insights emerge
- No new themes develop
- Categories are "saturated"

**Indicates:** You have adequate sample

# Part 3: Analysing Data

---

## General Principles

**Data analysis can take many forms**

Common methods in political science:
1. Content or theme analysis
2. Discourse analysis
3. Frame analysis
4. Dramaturgical analysis

**Key:** Choose method appropriate to your research questions and data type

---

## Content or Theme Analysis

**Definition:** Analysing data in relation to research questions; interpreting social and political meaning

**Materials:**
- Interview transcripts
- Documents (parliamentary transcripts, newspapers)
- Visual images
- Email messages, political speeches

**Evolution:**
- Originally "objective" counting
- Now interpretivist approach
- Focus on meaning, not just patterns

---

## Discourse Analysis

**Definition:** Uncovering how people/groups represent their actions in texts and language

**Core Premise:**
Language is structured according to patterns; these patterns reveal meanings and power relationships

**Focus:**
- How issues are discussed matters
- Texts, talk, visual objects
- Language patterns in different domains

**Applications:**
- Deliberative democracy studies
- Policy analysis
- Understanding perspectives and ideologies

---

## Frame Analysis

**Definition:** Reveals how beliefs, perceptions, and appreciations structure policies and positions

**Three Components:**
1. **Diagnosis** - What is the problem?
2. **Prognosis** - What is the solution?
3. **Call to Action** - Who is responsible? How to solve it?

**Used By:** Political parties, government agencies, social movements (intentionally and strategically)

---

## The Coding Process

**Seven Key Steps:**

1. **Organise and prepare** - transcribe, sort
2. **Read through all data** - get general sense
3. **Code the data** - bracket chunks, label categories
4. **Identify themes** - group codes into 5-7 themes
5. **Develop story line** - interconnect themes
6. **Add framework** (optional) - apply specific tradition
7. **Represent and interpret** - narratives, visuals, tables

---

## Three Types of Codes

### **Expected Codes**
Based on literature and common sense
- Example: "attitudes toward oneself" in bullying study

### **Surprising Codes**
Unexpected; emerged from data
- Example: "geo-warming impact" in leadership study

### **Unusual/Conceptual Codes**
Of particular interest to readers
- Example: "retriggering" in campus response study

---

## Coding Approaches

**Option 1: Emergent Only**
- Let codes develop naturally
- Traditional in social sciences

**Option 2: Predetermined Only**
- Use theory-based codes
- Popular in health sciences

**Option 3: Combination** (Recommended)
- Start with codebook
- Allow evolution based on data
- Balanced approach

---

## Ensuring Quality: Validation Strategies

**Qualitative Validity:** Checking the accuracy and credibility of findings

**Eight Key Strategies (Use Multiple!):**

.pull-left[

**Most Common &amp; Accessible:**

1. **Triangulation** - Multiple data sources converging on themes
2. **Member Checking** - Participants verify findings/themes
3. **Rich, Thick Description** - Detailed context for readers
4. **Clarify Researcher Bias** - Reflexivity about potential influence

]

.pull-right[

**Additional Strategies:**

5. **Negative Cases** - Present contradictory evidence
6. **Prolonged Engagement** - Extended time in field
7. **Peer Debriefing** - External reviewer questions study
8. **External Auditor** - Independent assessment of process

]

**Best Practice:** Use at least 2-3 strategies in your study



---

## Analysis vs. Interpretation: Key Distinction


.pull-left[

### **Analysis**
*What the data shows*

**Activities:**
- Organising data
- Reading through data
- Coding segments
- Identifying themes
- Developing story lines
- Applying frameworks
- Representing patterns

]

.pull-right[

**Output:**
- Themes and subthemes
- Patterns and relationships
- Descriptions
- Visual models

]

---

## Analysis vs. Interpretation: Key Distinction

.pull-left[

### **Interpretation**
*What the data means*

**Activities:**
- Lessons learned
- Comparing to literature/theory
- Personal insights/reflections
- Discussing implications
- Identifying limitations
- Suggesting future research
- Call for action (if transformative)

]

.pull-right[

**Output:**
- Deeper meaning
- "So what?" answers
- Theoretical contributions
- Practical implications

]

**Key Question for Interpretation:** "What were the lessons learned?" (Lincoln &amp; Guba)


---

## Group Task: Design Your Study (10 minutes)

.small[

.pull-left[

**Step 1: Choose a Research Topic**

- As a group, select one research topic
- Agree on a main research question

**Step 2: Plan Data Collection**

1. **Who would you study?**
   - Elite or non-elite participants? Why?
   - How many? What sampling strategy?

2. **Which methods would you use?** (Choose 2-3)
   - Semi-structured interviews?
   - Focus groups (homogeneous/heterogeneous/affinity)?
   - Documents (textual/visual)?
   - Observation (non-participatory / participatory / ethnography)?

]

.pull-right[

3\. **Justify your choices:**
   - Why are these methods appropriate for your question?
   - How would they complement each other?

4\. **Practical challenges:**
   - How would you gain access?
   - What ethical issues might arise?
  
]
   
]

## Group task: Scenario Options:

In group discuss one a research design for addressing one of these questions:

1. Understanding student activism: Why do some students join climate protests while others don't?
2. Social media and political identity: How do young people construct their political identities on Instagram/TikTok?
3. Trust in democratic institutions: What shapes citizens' trust (or distrust) in parliament?
4. Gender and political representation: How do women politicians experience barriers in their careers?
5. Grassroots organizing: How do community groups mobilize around local issues?
