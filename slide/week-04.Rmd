# Unit of analysis

---

## From theory to hypothesis

<img src = '../img/from-theory-to-hypothesis.png'></img>


## Unit of analysis

### In deciding what to measure for a concept of your interest, it is important to understand the unit of analysis.

The unit of analysis is the object that the hypothesis describes.

* It can be a person (in a survey/interview study)
* A country (in a cross-National comparison)
* An organization (in a comparative study of organizational behavior)
* A year (in a longitudinal analysis of a given country)
* Can also be multi-level (people within countries)

The unit of analysis often determines how a variable in a hypothesis is ‚Äúoperationalized‚Äù (i.e., measured)

Generally speaking, all variables in a hypothesis must have the same unit of analysis

---

## Unit of analysis

Note: For a given hypothesis, there can be many ways to operationalize depending on how you define the unit of analysis

**Example**: The higher the income level, the more likely citizens vote for the Republican party in the US

**Question**: How can you operationalize this hypothesis?

.pull-left[

**Answer (1)**: Unit of Analysis (Individuals)
* *A measure of income*: Ask a survey respondent, 'what is your household‚Äôs annual income?'
* *A measure of voter behaviour*: Ask a survey respondent, 'Which party‚Äôs candidate did you vote for in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election?' [R: Donald Trump; D: Joe Biden; Other‚Ä¶]

]

.pull-right[

**Answer (2)**: Unit of Analysis (State level)
* *A measure of income*: Average household income in the state
* *A measure of voter behaviour*: % of votes for the Republican candidate in the last election
* *Warning*: Ecological fallacy ‚Äì drawing inferences about individuals from group level behaviour

# Gathering evidence: 

.center[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlNcJDk5X6s0OoE/giphy.gif'></img>]

# Methodology, primary and secondary data


---

## Gathering evidence: Methodology

### Qualitative or quantitative?

* *Quantitative* methods: collecting and analysing data that can be analysed *numerically* using statistics;
    * E.g. surveys, experiments
    
* *Qualitative* methods: relies on words, description and *meaning* as sources of evidence rather than on the use of numbers.
    * E.g. interviews, focus groups, ethnography, document analysis

### Primary or secondary data?

* Primary data: New data / information that you collect yourself;

* Secondary data: Data / information collected by others.

---

## Why use secondary data?

* Many datasets free to access, saves money and time (cuts the ethics approval and data collection phase out of the research process);

* Quality of existing datasets is often high;

* Can enable longitudinal analysis (e.g. if someone else was collecting data since 1980s);

* Facilitates cross-National research;

* Making use of the extensive available data;

* Pools the resources of the social science community to do more than could be done individually.

---

## Secondary data sources in political science

* Cross-National surveys

    * Comparative Study of Electoral Systems
    * World Values Survey
    * Eurobarometer surveys
    
* Australian surveys

    * Australian Election Study
    * Australian Social Attitudes Survey
    
* Cross-National databases

    * Varieties of democracy (indicators of democracy for different countries)
    * Polity IV (indicators of democracy for different countries)
    * World Bank / OECD (economic indicators)

---

## Potential limitations of working with secondary data

* Data quality (can be very high, but need to assess)

* Data source may be missing measures for key variables of interest to answer research question

* Might not cover cases (e.g. countries) of interest

* Might not cover time-frame of interest

* Can produce data driven rather than question or problem driven research

---

## Why use primary data?

* Not relying on the availability of existing data;

* Questions drive data collection, not the other way around;

* Tailored to specific objectives;

* Generation of	new	data (can	share	with	the	research community).

---

## Types of primary data collection

* Focus on data collection from people (but can also collect data from institutions);

* Needs ethical consideration;

.pull-left[

* Main techniques:

    * Surveys (*quantitative*)
    
    * Experiments (*quantitative*)
    
    * Interviews (*qualitative*)
    
    * Ethnography (*qualitative*)

# Case selection: how many cases?

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/tWhSt6azAiDYhW9VhG/giphy.gif'></img>

---

## Some Basic Terms

* **Cases**

    * Countries that feature in the *Comparative Analysis*
    
    * But doesn‚Äôt need to be countries
    
        * E.g. villages, organisations, events

* **Variable**

    * A variable is an empirical property that can take on two or more values (e.g. at country level - economic growth, level of democracy)
    
    * Independent variable(s) (presumed cause(s))
    
    * Dependent variable (the presumed effect)

---

## Comparative methods: Types

.pull-left[

* **Types**

    * Case study: Single Country Study (n=1)
    
    * Small-N: Comparing Few Countries
    
    * Large-N: Comparing Many Countries
    
* **Criteria for Choosing Design**

    * Research question; time; method; epistemological position

## Small-N: Single Case Study

* **Focus**

    * In-depth analysis of one single case
    
    * Often qualitative, can be quantitative (e.g. survey data in a country)

* **Strengths**

    * In-depth
    * Theory generating
    
    * Theory confirming
    
    * Can focus on outlier countries

* **Weaknesses**

    * Results may not travel to other cases (generalizability / low external validity)
    
    * Selection Bias
    
---

## Small-N: The Comparative Approach

* **Focus**

    * Intentional selection of a few countries for comparison (often two or three cases)
    
    * Often qualitative, can be quantitative (e.g. survey data in a few countries)

* **Strengths**

    * ‚ÄòFocused comparison‚Äô of cases (MSSD vs. MDSD)
    
    * Good for theory building
    
    * Thick description ‚Äì in-depth
    
    * Area studies

* **Weaknesses**

    * Less secure inferences (low external validity)
    
    * Selection bias

---

## Large-N: The Statistical Method

* **Focus**

    * Quantitative analysis of aggregate data collected on different measures that vary across many countries
    
* **Strengths**

    * Extensive coverage of countries over space and time (breadth)
    
    * Ability to make strong inferences that hold for more cases than not (high external validity)
    
    * Use of statistical control to rule out rival explanations
    
    * Ability to identify outlier cases
    
* **Weaknesses**

    * N can be limited based on data availability
    
    * Need to have valid measures of concepts
    
    * Limited depth for each case (i.e. *thin* vs *thick* description)
