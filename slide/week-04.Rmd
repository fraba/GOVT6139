# Unit of analysis

---

## From theory to hypothesis

<img src = '../img/from-theory-to-hypothesis.png'></img>


## Unit of analysis

### In deciding what to measure for a concept of your interest, it is important to understand the unit of analysis.

The unit of analysis is the object that the hypothesis describes.

* It can be a person (in a survey/interview study)
* A country (in a cross-National comparison)
* An organization (in a comparative study of organizational behavior)
* A year (in a longitudinal analysis of a given country)
* Can also be multi-level (people within countries)

The unit of analysis often determines how a variable in a hypothesis is ‚Äúoperationalized‚Äù (i.e., measured)

Generally speaking, all variables in a hypothesis must have the same unit of analysis

---

## Unit of analysis

Note: For a given hypothesis, there can be many ways to operationalize depending on how you define the unit of analysis

**Example**: The higher the income level, the more likely citizens vote for the Republican party in the US

**Question**: How can you operationalize this hypothesis?

.pull-left[

**Answer (1)**: Unit of Analysis (Individuals)
* *A measure of income*: Ask a survey respondent, 'what is your household‚Äôs annual income?'
* *A measure of voter behaviour*: Ask a survey respondent, 'Which party‚Äôs candidate did you vote for in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election?' [R: Donald Trump; D: Joe Biden; Other‚Ä¶]

]

.pull-right[

**Answer (2)**: Unit of Analysis (State level)
* *A measure of income*: Average household income in the state
* *A measure of voter behaviour*: % of votes for the Republican candidate in the last election
* *Warning*: Ecological fallacy ‚Äì drawing inferences about individuals from group level behaviour

# Gathering evidence: 

.center[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlNcJDk5X6s0OoE/giphy.gif'></img>]

# Methodology, primary and secondary data


---

## Gathering evidence: Methodology

### Qualitative or quantitative?

* *Quantitative* methods: collecting and analysing data that can be analysed *numerically* using statistics;
    * E.g. surveys, experiments
    
* *Qualitative* methods: relies on words, description and *meaning* as sources of evidence rather than on the use of numbers.
    * E.g. interviews, focus groups, ethnography, document analysis

### Primary or secondary data?

* Primary data: New data / information that you collect yourself;

* Secondary data: Data / information collected by others.

---

## Why use secondary data?

* Many datasets free to access, saves money and time (cuts the ethics approval and data collection phase out of the research process);

* Quality of existing datasets is often high;

* Can enable longitudinal analysis (e.g. if someone else was collecting data since 1980s);

* Facilitates cross-National research;

* Making use of the extensive available data;

* Pools the resources of the social science community to do more than could be done individually.

---

## Secondary data sources in political science

* Cross-National surveys

    * Comparative Study of Electoral Systems
    * World Values Survey
    * Eurobarometer surveys
    
* Australian surveys

    * Australian Election Study
    * Australian Social Attitudes Survey
    
* Cross-National databases

    * Varieties of democracy (indicators of democracy for different countries)
    * Polity IV (indicators of democracy for different countries)
    * World Bank / OECD (economic indicators)

---

## Potential limitations of working with secondary data

* Data quality (can be very high, but need to assess)

* Data source may be missing measures for key variables of interest to answer research question

* Might not cover cases (e.g. countries) of interest

* Might not cover time-frame of interest

* Can produce data driven rather than question or problem driven research

---

## Why use primary data?

* Not relying on the availability of existing data;

* Questions drive data collection, not the other way around;

* Tailored to specific objectives;

* Generation of	new	data (can	share	with	the	research community).

---

## Types of primary data collection

* Focus on data collection from people (but can also collect data from institutions);

* Needs ethical consideration;

.pull-left[

* Main techniques:

    * Surveys (*quantitative*)
    
    * Experiments (*quantitative*)
    
    * Interviews (*qualitative*)
    
    * Ethnography (*qualitative*)

# Case selection: how many cases?

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/tWhSt6azAiDYhW9VhG/giphy.gif'></img>

---

## Some Basic Terms

* **Cases**

    * Countries that feature in the *Comparative Analysis*
    
    * But doesn‚Äôt need to be countries
    
        * E.g. villages, organisations, events

* **Variable**

    * A variable is an empirical property that can take on two or more values (e.g. at country level - economic growth, level of democracy)
    
    * Independent variable(s) (presumed cause(s))
    
    * Dependent variable (the presumed effect)

---

## Comparative methods: Types

.pull-left[

* **Types**

    * Case study: Single Country Study (n=1)
    
    * Small-N: Comparing Few Countries
    
    * Large-N: Comparing Many Countries
    
* **Criteria for Choosing Design**

    * Research question; time; method; epistemological position

## Small-N: Single Case Study

* **Focus**

    * In-depth analysis of one single case
    
    * Often qualitative, can be quantitative (e.g. survey data in a country)

* **Strengths**

    * In-depth
    * Theory generating
    
    * Theory confirming
    
    * Can focus on outlier countries

* **Weaknesses**

    * Results may not travel to other cases (generalizability / low external validity)
    
    * Selection Bias
    
---

## Small-N: The Comparative Approach

* **Focus**

    * Intentional selection of a few countries for comparison (often two or three cases)
    
    * Often qualitative, can be quantitative (e.g. survey data in a few countries)

* **Strengths**

    * ‚ÄòFocused comparison‚Äô of cases (MSSD vs. MDSD)
    
    * Good for theory building
    
    * Thick description ‚Äì in-depth
    
    * Area studies

* **Weaknesses**

    * Less secure inferences (low external validity)
    
    * Selection bias

---

## Large-N: The Statistical Method

* **Focus**

    * Quantitative analysis of aggregate data collected on different measures that vary across many countries
    
* **Strengths**

    * Extensive coverage of countries over space and time (breadth)
    
    * Ability to make strong inferences that hold for more cases than not (high external validity)
    
    * Use of statistical control to rule out rival explanations
    
    * Ability to identify outlier cases
    
* **Weaknesses**

    * N can be limited based on data availability
    
    * Need to have valid measures of concepts
    
    * Limited depth for each case (i.e. *thin* vs *thick* description)

### Selection bias

.pull-left[

**What is selection bias?**

Those included in the study are different to those excluded ‚Äì in a way that influences study result.

It‚Äôs a risk if you select cases by the dependent variable.

Although in practice Mill‚Äôs methods are fine for small-N comparative research.<sup>1</sup> 

.footnote[[1] What do we mean by this?]

]

.pull-right[

*Example*

**RQ: How to be successful?**

* Selection bias:
    * Look at the habits of ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù people only.
    * Infer that traits shared by successful people have led to their success. e.g. rising early, hard work, exercise etc.
    
* Better: Look at the habits of lots of people (both ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù and ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù).
    * Are there traits common among the successful people but not the unsuccessful people?

]

#### Example: Selection bias ‚Äì COVID-19 testing in March 2020

.pull-left[

At beginning of the pandemic, requirement to get tested for COVID-19 in many places:
* International travel in the 14 days before the onset of illness.
or
* Close contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of COVID-19.
Conclusions drawn about who gets COVID-19

> ... the rest of our confirmed cases, to this day, have <mark>either had overseas or interstate travel or they have had contact with a confirmed case</mark>.<sup>1<sup>

]

.pull-right[

> ... people returning from overseas, <mark>which is currently the greatest source of cases</mark>. <sup>2</sup>

**What is the problem here?**

* They have limited variation on their independent variables (overseas travel / contact with a confirmed case) by only allowing one value of their independent variables

* Need to have variation in independent variables. E.g. testing people who had/hadn‚Äôt been overseas and assess effects on dependent variable ‚Äì testing positive for COVID-19.

### Geddes (1990) ‚Äì How the cases you choose affect the answers you get

Geddes advises *against* selection on the dependent variable because of **two types of errors**

1. Concluding that any *factor shared* by the cases is the cause of the dependent variable

2. Assuming that the relationship identified *within* the set of cases would apply to other cases

**Solution?**

* Random selection of cases
* Cases should vary on the independent variable

## Selecting cases for a large N cross-national study using survey research

### Considerations

* What are the existing datasets?

* Which dataset has the best fit in terms of:

    * Countries of interest
    * Survey questions that measure concepts of interest
    * Survey timing
    
* Of the countries covered, which countries should I include:

    * All countries for which there is data?
    * Just democratic countries? Just authoritarian countries?
    * Countries in a particular region or grouping (e.g. OECD)?
    
* All depends on your research question and the theory you would like to test

### Selecting cases for a large N cross-national study using survey research

* Major comparative survey datasets

    * Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (1996-present, 57 countries)
    
        * Timed with elections, Questions focused on elections; mostly democratic OECD countries.
        
    * World Values Survey (1981-present, over 100 countries, waves every 5 years or so)
    
        * Questions focused on values, attitudes, political behavior; wide range of countries ‚Äì variation in political system & economic development.
        
    * Regional barometer surveys (e.g. Eurobarometer, Asian barometer)
    
    * European Social Survey
    
* Which countries are included?

    * Depends on funding available, initiative of country teams, and survey focus.

## Example: Selecting cases for a study of the effects of the global financial crisis (2007-08) on citizen political engagement in cross-national comparison

### Considerations

1. Survey timing ‚Äì to have a quasi experimental research design ‚Äì needed data from before and after the ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô the financial crisis

2.	Survey question wording - Need cross-national survey instrument with questions on my dependent variables (protest participation, civic engagement, support for democracy)

3.	Country coverage ‚Äì Are countries of interest included? Should have variation ‚Äì countries hard hit and not hard hit by crisis

Selected 18 countries in the *World Values Survey* (WVS). WVS was best fit on 1. and 2. although was missing some key countries of interest (e.g. Greece) on 3.

#  Selecting cases for large-N cross-national study

Can be country level data (different unit of analysis)

* Driven by data availability

* More cases = more statistical power

* Potential variables: level of economic growth (World Bank, OECD), level of democracy (Varieties of Democracy), corruption (Corruption Perceptions Index)

Examples:

* Przeworski and Limongi (1997) Modernization Theories and Facts

* Sung (2004) Democracy and political corruption: A cross-national comparison

## Exercise: Designing a [case / small-N / large-N] study

Forms groups of max. 6 students, then join one of the groups in Week 04 on Canvas. 

Say we're interested in explaining *the effects of economic development (independent variable) on citizen participation in protest (dependent variable)*.

What are some ways we could design a research project around this, as:

* A case study (Groups 01, 05, 09)

* A small-N comparative study using MSSD (Groups 02, 06, 10)

* A small-N comparative study using MDSD (Groups 03, 07, 11)

* A large-N comparative study (Groups 04, 08, 12)

Consider the characteristics of each approach and consider the variables you might want to include. 

Then suggest what cases you would select and why.

Post your answer in Canvas, then share it in Paddlet.
