# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop

### Part 1: 5-minute project presentation (45 minutes)

- Prepare to present your research proposal in five minutes.

- You are encouraged to preliminary share supporting materials using the [Canvas Group](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Groups/ta-p/16) page for Week 12 (e.g. a one or two slide deck, or a one-page document). 

- In groups of four, each student will present for five minutes - I will be strict with the timing - and then receive questions and comments for another five minutes.

- You are encouraged to keep discussing this on the Canvas groups page after class.

---

# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop

### Part 2: Brain storm on the issues you have identified with the presentations you reviewed (30 minutes)

- Prepare a (short) list of issues to discuss with your group (but avoid offering details that could identify the proposal you have reviewed). 

- In the same groups of four, discuss the issues and possible solutions for about 20 minutes.

- Report on your discussion using Padlet (same as before, avoid offering details that could identify specific proposals): list issues and possible solutions.

# R and RStudio

## R and RStudio

* <img src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg" style="width: 8%" /> is an *objected-oriented* computer language, that is "formal language used to communicate with a computer"). 

    * It is widely used among social scientists to work with data and statistical applications...
    
    * ... but it's a fully fledged computer language (so you can use it to send a rocket to Mars, if you want). 

--

* <img src="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-flat.svg" style="width: 18%" /> is an application - formally, an integrated development environment (IDE) - designed to facilitate using R. 

    * RStudio comes in two versions: a desktop application and a server application (which you access from a browser)

### Rstudio: Let's creat our first R script

An R script is a text document that we can edit and save it for later use. 

An R script has a ".R" extension (sometimes lower-cased, ".r"). 

I contains our R code and it can be run by R.

When you open a new R script document it will be blank.

## RStudio user interface: How does it look?

After launching RStudio, you should see four windows. Each windows has a number of tabs (like in a web browser). The most important tabs are:

]

1. **Upper-left window**: Your source code appears in the **source editor**.

2. **Lower-left window**:  The **console**. Your R code will execute here. Code output (including errors and messages) is visualised here.

3. **Lower-right window**: Your local *files* and *plots* can be accessed from here. 

2. **Upper-right window**: This is a list of objects in your current **environment**.

## RStudio: Running code from the editor

If you want to run some code (and for *run* we mean *write* the code, then ask run to *execute* it) you can add it to a new document in your **source editor**. 

In your **source editor** each tab represents a different document. These are text documents containing R code. 

You can write your code here and you can save your document containing the code for later use (with "File" then "Save") as you would save a Word document. 

Once you have a line of code you can *place your cursor* on the line and then hit "Run". 

#### By hitting "Run"...

1. You ask *RStudio* to copy paste your line into the **console**;

2. You ask *R* to execute your code. R will kindly do it and will print any outcome below your code directly in the **console**. 

3. If your code results in creating a *new object*, the object will now appear in the **environment** window.

## Example 1: Health data<sup>1</sup>

```{r echo = F}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```

```{r echo = F}

health %>%
  dplyr::slice(1:5) %>%
  kable()

```

## Predict one variable using another variable

Given the value $X_i$, what is our best guess for the value of $Y_i$?

* The **dependent variable** $Y_i$ is our *outcome* variable.

* The **independent variable** $X_i$ is our *predictor* (also *explanatory*) variable.

---

## Import the data

```{r}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```


.center[<img src = '../img/rstudio-import.gif' width = '95%'></img>]

---

## Import the data (breakdown)

When we use the RStudio **import feature** (shown before), we are actually asking RStudio to write this code for us.  

```{r}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```

(Once RStudio send this code to the console, we should copy/paste it to our text document open in the source editor window)

This code does two things:

1. The **function** `read.csv("../data/health.csv")` read a comma-separated file (CSV) file, which we specify within the two parenthesis and the two quote signs.

2. The **assignment operator** `<-` take the result from the function and assign it to the object `health`.

---

## Import the data (breakdown)

```{r}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```

* A *function* is a machine that can optionally take an *input* (a list of **arguments** in computer science) - and return an *output*.

* With the arrow `<-` we tell R where to store the *output* from the function. 

* In R information is stored in *objects*. The objects in the *environment* are of different **types** as they contain different type of information.

## View the data

.center[<img src = '../img/rstudio-view.gif' width = '95%'></img>]

---

## Plot the data

.center[<img src = '../img/rstudio-plot.gif' width = '95%'></img>]

---

## Plot the data (breakdown)

```{r eval = F}
plot(health$steps.lag, health$steps)
```


1. We need to use a *function* to plot the data. The function we want to use is `plot()`. Functions can take one or more arguments. In this case, our arguments are 

    * the values for the horizontal axis (X), and
    
    * the values for the vertical axis (Y)
    
2. As we have already imported our dataset `health` (with "import dataset") into our R session (you should be able to see it in the top-right window in RStudio), we can access the values for the two axis with

    * `health$steps.lag`, in which `steps.lag` is the name of our X variable, and
    
    * `health$weight` in which `weight` is the name of our Y variable.

---

## Remove missing values

Let's calculate the correlation coefficient between the two variables with the function `cor()`

```{r}
cor(health$steps.lag, health$weight)
```

**Ouch**! We have some missing value in our data set (a very common issue). 

Conveniently, R has a function to help us out: `na.omit()`

```{r}
health <- na.omit(health)
```

With this code we remove all the records that contain missing data (`NA` in R). You might want to notice that the number of observations changes from 644 to 643 after you running it.

---

## Calculate the correlation coefficient

```{r}
cor(health$steps.lag, health$weight)
```

Remember that,

1. positive correlation -> upward slope

2. negative correlation -> downward slope

3. high correlation -> tighter, closer to a line

4. correlation cannot capture nonlinear relationship.

## Linear regression with one Independent Variable (IV)

This is the equation for the model of the line that best fits the points:

$$Y_i = \underbrace{\alpha}_{intercept} + \underbrace{\beta}_{slope} \times X_i + \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{error\:term} $$


---

## Linear regression with more than one Independent Variable (IV)

$$Y_i = \underbrace{\alpha}_{intercept} + \underbrace{\beta_1}_{coefficient\\first\:IV} \ \  \underbrace{X_{i1}}_{values\\first\:IV} \ + \ \underbrace{\beta_2}_{coefficient\\second\:IV} \ \  \underbrace{X_{i2}}_{values\\second\:IV} + ... + \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{error\:term}$$

### Why do we want to add additional predictor variables (IVs)?

1. We improve our **predictions** ( $Y_i$ ), as we provide the model more information. (Of course this assumption rests on the *quality of information* we provide to the model) 

2. We can offer a better **interpretations** of the relationships among our variables: " $\beta_1$ is the effect of $X_i$ *holding all other independent variables constant* " => a.k.a. **ceteris paribus**.
