## Feedback on A1, tips for A2

Overall, well done!

* Be selective: You must explain something but you can't explain everything.

* **Demonstrate and communicate understanding** of ideas covered in the course (you do this by *explaining* and not by *listing* facts)

* **Connect** these research design / methods ideas to your topic of choice

* In your A2, remember to **engage explicitly with research design and methods literature**

---

# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop


.center[**Your draft is due tonight**!]

* Make sure that your draft is not longer than 4,000 words (the limit for A2)

* Yet, it is OK to submit a draft that is shorter than 4,000 words (in fact, you should submit whatever version you currently have). 

#### Tomorrow I will start assigning peer reviewers. As peer reviewer

* You should try to offer a feedback to three drafts. 

* After reading a draft, use the rubric you find in Canvas. You can also explain your assessment with a written comment in Canvas (I am sure the other student will appreciate it!). 

* If the document you are assigned to review is longer than 4,000 words, you should only read up to 4,000 words and disregard the rest (you can make a comment about this with your feedback).

* As you review the drafts, take notes on critical/recurrent issues you might have encountered (so to discuss them in Week 12 in class).

# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop

### Part 1: 5-minute project presentation (45 minutes)

- Prepare to present your research proposal in five minutes.

- You are encouraged to preliminary share supporting materials using the [Canvas Group](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Groups/ta-p/16) page for Week 12 (e.g. a one or two slide deck, or a one-page document). 

- In groups of four (groups have been already created), each student will present for five minutes - I will be strict with the timing - and then receive questions and comments for another five minutes.

- You are encouraged to keep discussing this on the Canvas groups page after class.

---

# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop

### Part 2: Brain storm on the issues you have identified with the presentations you reviewed (30 minutes)

- Prepare a (short) list of issues to discuss with your group (but avoid offering details that could identify the proposal you have reviewed). 

- In the same groups of four, discuss the issues and possible solutions for about 20 minutes.

- Report on your discussion using Padlet (same as before, avoid offering details that could identify specific proposals): list issues and possible solutions.

---

## R and RStudio

* <img src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg" style="width: 8%" /> is an *objected-oriented* computer language, that is "formal language used to communicate with a computer"). 

    * It is widely used among social scientists to work with data and statistical applications...
    
    * ... but it's a fully fledged computer language (so you can use it to send a rocket to Mars, if you want). 

--

* <img src="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-flat.svg" style="width: 18%" /> is an application - formally, an integrated development environment (IDE) - designed to facilitate using R. 

    * RStudio comes in two versions: a desktop application and a server application (which you access from a browser)

### Rstudio: Let's creat our first R script

An R script is a text document that we can edit and save it for later use. 

An R script has a ".R" extension (sometimes lower-cased, ".r"). 

I contains our R code and it can be run by R.

When you open a new R script document it will be blank.

## RStudio user interface: How does it look?

After launching RStudio, you should see four windows. Each windows has a number of tabs (like in a web browser). The most important tabs are:

## RStudio: Running code from the editor

If you want to run some code (and for *run* we mean *write* the code, then ask run to *execute* it) you can add it to a new document in your **source editor**. 

In your **source editor** each tab represents a different document. These are text documents containing R code. 

You can write your code here and you can save your document containing the code for later use (with "File" then "Save") as you would save a Word document. 

Once you have a line of code you can *place your cursor* on the line and then hit "Run". 

#### By hitting "Run"...

1. You ask *RStudio* to copy paste your line into the **console**;

2. You ask *R* to execute your code. R will kindly do it and will print any outcome below your code directly in the **console**. 

3. If your code results in creating a *new object*, the object will now appear in the **environment** window.

# Predict one variable using another variable
# Example 1: Health data

---

## Example 1: Health data<sup>1</sup>

```{r echo = F}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```

```{r echo = F}

health %>%
  dplyr::slice(1:5) %>%
  kable()

```

## Predict one variable using another variable

Given the value $X_i$, what is our best guess for the value of $Y_i$?

* The **dependent variable** $Y_i$ is our *outcome* variable.

* The **independent variable** $X_i$ is our *predictor* (also *explanatory*) variable.

---

## Import the data

```{r}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```


.center[<img src = '../img/rstudio-import.gif' width = '95%'></img>]

---

## Import the data (breakdown)

When we use the RStudio **import feature** (shown before), we are actually asking RStudio to write this code for us.  

```{r}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```

(Once RStudio send this code to the console, we should copy/paste it to our text document open in the source editor window)

This code does two things:

1. The **function** `read.csv("../data/health.csv")` read a comma-separated file (CSV) file, which we specify within the two parenthesis and the two quote signs.

2. The **assignment operator** `<-` take the result from the function and assign it to the object `health`.

---

```{r}

health <- read.csv("../data/health.csv")

```

* A *function* is a machine that can optionally take an *input* (a list of **arguments** in computer science) - and return an *output*.

* With the arrow `<-` we tell R where to store the *output* from the function. 

* In R information is stored in *objects*. The objects in the *environment* are of different **types** as they contain different type of information.

## Plot the data

.center[<img src = '../img/rstudio-plot.gif' width = '95%'></img>]

---

## Plot the data (breakdown)

```{r eval = F}
plot(health$steps.lag, health$steps)
```


1. We need to use a *function* to plot the data. The function we want to use is `plot()`. Functions can take one or more arguments. In this case, our arguments are 

    * the values for the horizontal axis (X), and
    
    * the values for the vertical axis (Y)
    
2. As we have already imported our dataset `health` (with "import dataset") into our R session (you should be able to see it in the top-right window in RStudio), we can access the values for the two axis with

    * `health$steps.lag`, in which `steps.lag` is the name of our X variable, and
    
    * `health$weight` in which `weight` is the name of our Y variable.

---

## Remove missing values

Let's calculate the correlation coefficient between the two variables with the function `cor()`

```{r}
cor(health$steps.lag, health$weight)
```

**Ouch**! We have some missing value in our data set (a very common issue). 

Conveniently, R has a function to help us out: `na.omit()`

```{r}
health <- na.omit(health)
```

With this code we remove all the records that contain missing values (`NA` in R). You might want to notice that the number of observations changes from 644 to 643 after you running it.

---

## Calculate the correlation coefficient

```{r}
cor(health$steps.lag, health$weight)
```

Remember that,

1. positive correlation -> upward slope

2. negative correlation -> downward slope

3. high correlation -> tighter, closer to a line

4. correlation cannot capture nonlinear relationship.

## Linear regression with one Independent Variable (IV)<sup>1</sup>

This is the equation for the model of the line that best fits the points:

$$Y_i = \underbrace{\alpha}_{intercept} + \underbrace{\beta}_{slope} \times X_i + \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{error\:term}$$
**Coefficients**/**parameters** ( $\alpha$ , $\beta$ ): true unknown intercept/slope of the line of best fit.

* **Chance error** $\epsilon_i$ : accounts for the fact that the line doesn't perfectly fit the data.

    * Each observation allowed to be off the regression line.
    * Chance errors are 0 on average.
    
We don't know $\alpha$ or $\beta$ . *How can we estimate them*?

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression.pdf]


---

## Estimating coefficients<sup>1</sup>

* Parameters: $\alpha$, $\beta$

    * Unknown features of the data-generating process.

    * Chance error makes these impossible to observe directly.
    
* Estimates: $\widehat{\alpha}$, $\widehat{\beta}$

    * An **estimate** is a function of the data that is our best guess about some
parameter.

* **Regression line**: $\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\alpha} + \widehat{\beta} \times x$

    * *Average* value of $Y$ when $X$ is equal to $x$.
    
    * Represents the *best guess* or *predicted value* of the outcome at $x$.

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression.pdf]

## Line of best fit<sup>1</sup>

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '75%', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}

ggplot(health, aes(x = steps.lag, y = weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Steps on day prior (in 1000s)', 
       y = "Weight")

```


.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression.pdf]

---

## Why not this line?<sup>1</sup>

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '55%', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = health, aes(x = steps.lag, y = weight)) +
  geom_smooth(data = health %>%
                mutate(weight = rev(weight)), aes(x = steps.lag, y = weight), 
              method = 'lm', se = FALSE, colour = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = 'Steps on day prior (in 1000s)', 
       y = "Weight")

```


Because we minimise the **sum of the squared residuals** (SSR) and this line doesn't minimise SSRs.

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression.pdf]

---

## Calculating the least squares line for a data set with `lm()`

In R we "fit the model" with the syntax <mark>`lm(y ~ x, data = mydataset)`</mark>, where `y` is our DV and `x` our IV.


```{r}
fit <- lm(weight ~ steps.lag, data = health)
```

The object `fit` now contains all the stats from fitting the linear model. 

We get the coefficients $\alpha$ (the coefficient) and $\beta$ by entering `fit` in console

```{r}
fit
```

---

#### Intepreting the results from `lm()`

We get more comprehensive results with 

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

---

#### Intepreting the results from `lm()`

.center[<img src = '../img/r-lm-summary-1.gif' width = '95%'></img>]

---

#### Intepreting the results from `lm()`

* $\alpha$ (intercept) = 170.67497: *average* weight in pounds when walking 0 steps the previous day.

* $\beta_1 = -0.23077$: *average* change in pounds when walking an extra step the previous day.

* $p = 1.11e-06$ for `steps.lag`: the association between `steps.lag` and `weight` is statistically significant (note significant codes).

* $r^2 = 0.03637$*: 3.6% of the variation in the dependent variable `weight` is explained by the variation of the independent variable `steps.lag` (not great, a lot remains uneplained).

---

## In class excercise:

Discuss in group, then submit individually your response in Canvas.

1. Download the "Explaining the Trump vote" (available from the Assignment page on Canvas).

2. Go to Table 1 on page 531 (you can read the rest of the paper at home in interested!)

**Note**: As it is common, the table reports more than one model. Coefficients from each model are in a different column. You might also note that each model has different combination of independent variables.

#### Task

1. Identify the dependent variable (DV) and the independent variables (IVs)

2. Identify the variables that have a significant effect on voting for Trump (specify the model number).

# Linear regression with more than one Independent Variable
# Example 2: US midterm elections

---

## Example 2: US midterm elections<sup>1</sup>

| Variable name | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `year` | midterm election year |
| `president` | name of president |
| `party` | Democrat or Republican |
| `approval` | Gallup approval rating at midterms |
| `seat.change` | change in the number of House seat's for the president's party |
| `rdi.change` | change in real disposable income over the year before |


.footnote[[1] Slides from http://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression-ii.pdf]

---

## Import the data in R

Use RStudio's "**Import Dataset feature**" ([here](https://fraba.github.io/GOVT6139/img/rstudio-import.gif) how) to get this code as your *path* th the `midterms.csv` file will be different.

```{r}
midterms <- read.csv("../data/midterms.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
midterms %>%
  dplyr::slice(1:5) %>%
  kable()
```

## Linear regression with more than one Independent Variable (IV)<sup>1</sup>

$$Y_i = \underbrace{\alpha}_{intercept} + \underbrace{\beta_1}_{coefficient\\first\:IV} \ \  \underbrace{X_{i1}}_{values\\first\:IV} \ + \ \underbrace{\beta_2}_{coefficient\\second\:IV} \ \  \underbrace{X_{i2}}_{values\\second\:IV} + ... + \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{error\:term}$$

### Why do we want to add additional predictor variables (IVs)?

1. We improve our **predictions** ( $Y_i$ ), as we provide the model more information. (Of course this assumption rests on the *quality of information* we provide to the model) 

2. We can offer a better **interpretations** of the relationships among our variables: " $\beta_1$ is the effect of $X_i$ *holding all other independent variables constant* " => a.k.a. **ceteris paribus**.

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression-ii.pdf]

## Predicting with multiple independent variables<sup>1</sup>

Let's say we want to predict the **change of House seat's for the president's party** using 

1. president's **approval rate** and 

2. **change in real disposable income over the year before**. 

#### With this data set, our function will then be

$$ seat.change_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \times approval_i + \beta_2 \times rdi.change_i + \epsilon_i $$

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression-ii.pdf]
---


## Predicting with multiple independent variables in R<sup>1</sup>

```{r}
mult.fit <- lm(seat.change ~ approval + rdi.change, data = midterms)

mult.fit
```


* $\alpha$ = -117.2: *average* seat change president has 0% approval and no change
in income levels.
* $\beta_1 = 1.61$: *average* increase in seat change for additional percentage point
of approval, **holding RDI change fixed**
* $\beta_2 =  4.213$: *average* increase in seat change for each additional percentage
point increase of RDI, **holding approval fixed**

## Can we predict the result of the 2018 midterm election?<sup>1</sup>

Let's assume that we are the day before of the 2018 midterm election and we want to estimate the result of the election in terms of seat change. 

Our line of best fit let us produce an estimate for that election...

.center[<img src = 'https://media.tenor.com/QvDDT72U7lUAAAAC/crystal-ball.gif' width = '45%'></img>]

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression-ii.pdf]

---

#### Can we predict the result of the 2018 midterm election?<sup>1</sup>

Let's check the values for our predictors (or IVs): `approval` and `rdi.change`.

```{r echo = F}
midterms %>%
  dplyr::filter(year == 2018) %>%
  kable()
```

and the coefficients from our linear model

```{r}
mult.fit
```

.footnote[[1] Slides from https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/gov50/regression-ii.pdf]
---

#### Can we predict the result of the 2018 midterm election?

Now we only need to plug the values into our formula

$$seat.change_{2018} = \alpha + \beta_1 \times approval_{2018} + \beta_2 \times rdi.change_{2018}$$
##### First the coefficients ...

$$seat.change_{2018} = -120.436 + 1.572 \times approval_{2018} + 3.334 \times rdi.change_{2018}$$
##### Then the measured values of the IVs from 2018 ...

$$ seat.change_{2018} = -120.436 + 1.572 \times 38 + 3.334 \times 4.1 $$
which we can solve using R

```{r}
-120.436 + 1.572 * 38 + 3.334 * 4.1
```

Who can check the Wikipedia page for the 2018 United States House of Representatives elections?

---

## Does the model with a single IV produces better predictions?

```{r}
fit <- lm(seat.change ~ approval, data = midterms)

fit
```

Actually, it does ...

```{r}
-96.845 + 1.424 * 38
```

Adding the economic variable, which is not significantly associated according to our statistical test, decreases the accuracy of our prediction. 

Approval rate by itself is already a pretty effective predictor.
