# Part 1: Introduction

---

## What is Qualitative Research?

**Core Focus:**
Understanding the **meaning** underlying intentions, actions, objects, or phenomena

**Key Principle:**
Explanation cannot be independent of context

**Questions Answered:**
- **What** is happening? (descriptive)
- **How** did this occur? (process)
- **Why** did this happen? (explanatory)

**Method:**
In-depth analysis through 'thick' description, case studies, or small-N comparisons

---

## Historical Context

**Early Foundations (19th Century)**
- John Stuart Mill and early methodological statements

**The 'Golden Age' (1960s onwards)**
- Rise of feminist research
- Critique of positivist methodologies
- Emphasis on lived experiences and voices previously ignored

**Today:**
- Increasingly sophisticated methods
- Integration of digital technologies
- Decolonising methodologies
- Still contested in some fields

---

## Core Characteristics

1. **Participants' meanings** - not researcher's preconceptions
2. **Natural settings** - not laboratories
3. **Researcher as instrument** - direct collection and interpretation
4. **Multiple data sources** - triangulation
5. **Context-dependent** - understanding within specific settings
6. **Textual and verbal focus** - including silences and omissions
7. **Reflexivity** - acknowledging researcher's role and biases

---

## The Approach or Design: Two Options

.pull-left[

.small[

### **Descriptive Methods**
- Based on everyday language of participants
- Little interpretation from pre-existing theory
- Maximum variation in sampling
- Cataloguing data into themes

### **Analytic Frameworks**
Examples: narrative study, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, case study
- Specific frameworks for data collection and analysis
- Limited variability in application


]

]

.pull-right[

.small[

- Popularised in specific disciplines
- Have philosophical foundations

**When Writing About Your Design:**
1. Identify specific approach with literature references
2. Provide background information about the approach
3. Discuss why it's appropriate for your study
4. Identify how approach will shape your design process

## Research Topics in Political Science
*Applicable to Social Sciences Generally*

**Core Questions:**
- How are societies governed?
- How is power distributed and used?
- How are collective decisions made?
- How do actors interact with institutions?

**Levels of Analysis:**
- Macro: Institutional and structural forces
- Meso: Organisations, groups, movements  
- Micro: Individual engagement and participation

---

## When to Use Qualitative Methods

**Ideal For:**
- Understanding meanings people give to actions
- Exploring processes and "how" questions
- Studying institutions, actors, events in context
- Capturing lived experiences
- Uncovering what's left unsaid
- Identifying causal mechanisms not evident elsewhere

**Can Be Used With:**
- Positivist OR interpretivist epistemologies
- Different purposes depending on research goals

---

# Part 2: Generating Data

---

## Three Primary Approaches

**1. Talking to People**
- Interviews (elite and non-elite)
- Focus groups

**2. Collecting Relevant Materials**
- Documents (textual)
- Visual and audio-visual data

**3. Observing with Different Degrees of Involvement**
- Non-participatory observation
- Participatory observation and ethnography

---

## Interviews: Semi-Structured Approach

**Why Use Interviews:**
- Probe individual understandings
- Identify causal mechanisms
- Get insider perspectives
- Capture historical information

**Semi-Structured Format:**
- Clear questions/issues prepared
- Flexible order and coverage
- Allow interview to shape progression
- Appropriate when limited prior knowledge exists

---

## Elite vs. Non-Elite Interviews

### **Elite Interviews**
- Politicians, senior bureaucrats, organisational heads
- Hold/held powerful positions
- Seek insider first-hand experiences
- Challenge: Power imbalances, access

### **Non-Elite Interviews**
- Unique political/social experiences
- Don't embody institutional power
- May represent disadvantaged groups
- Focus: Lived experiences, particular needs

---

## Focus Groups

**Definition:** Small group (6-8 people) discussing shared concept or experience

**Why Use Them:**
- Observe group interaction and discussion
- See how understanding develops collectively
- Identify points of agreement and disagreement
- Study the process itself

**Three Types:**
1. **Homogeneous** - similar backgrounds
2. **Heterogeneous** - diverse backgrounds  
3. **Affinity groups** - pre-existing groups

---

## Collecting Documents: Textual Data

.pull-left[

**Public Documents:**
- Government publications, policy documents
- Parliamentary transcripts
- Meeting minutes, official reports
- Newspapers, media articles

**Private Documents:**
- Personal journals, diaries
- Letters, emails
- Private blogs

]

.pull-right[

**Can Be:**
- Objective sources
- Or objects of analysis themselves (social products/cultural artefacts)

]



---

## Collecting Documents: Visual Data

**Types:**
- Photographs, videos, films
- Paintings, cartoons, graffiti
- Advertisements, posters
- Social media images (memes)
- Art objects, stamps

**Why Important:**
- Frame what can be seen, thought, and said
- Delineate what's politically possible
- Rich sources for understanding ideologies
- Increasingly important in social media age

---

## Photo-Elicitation

**Method:**
Use images to elicit comments and discussion

**Process:**
- Images provided by researcher OR created by participants
- Often combined with interviews or focus groups
- Particularly useful for sensitive/abstract topics

**Example:** Marsh et al. (2006)
- Gave young people various pictures
- Asked to sort into "political" vs "non-political"
- Revealed their understanding without imposing definitions

---

## Observation: Degrees of Involvement

.pull-left[

**Non-Participatory:**
- Avoid intervention in observed situations
- Document context and events
- Capture mundane, everyday experiences

**Participatory:**
- Researcher immerses in what they study
- Active involvement in setting
- Extended time periods

]

.pull-right[

**Ethnography:**
- Understanding culture through immersion
- Participant observation
- Produces "thick description"
- Explores power relationships

]



---

## Ethnography Examples

**Mansbridge (1980)** - Adversary Democracy
- 2+ years observing town hall meetings
- Distinguished unitary vs adversary democracy

**Curato (2019)** - Deliberative Democracy in Disasters
- Ethnography in disaster-affected Philippines
- Revealed creative forms democracy takes

**Zacka (2017)** - Street-Level Bureaucrats
- 8 months as welfare agency receptionist
- Revealed bureaucrats as moral agents with discretion

---

## Reflexivity in Data Generation

**Definition:** Explicit acknowledgment of researcher's value positions and how choices are shaped by values

**Required:**
- Transparency about subject matter choices
- Reflection on research questions
- How and what data is collected
- How analysis and interpretations are shaped
- Interaction with research field

**Purpose:** Ensure research process is transparent and researcher influence is acknowledged

---

## Group Task: Design Your Study (10 minutes)

.small[

.pull-left[

**Step 1: Choose a Research Topic**

- As a group, select one research topic relevant to your field
- Agree on a main research question

**Step 2: Plan Data Collection**

1. **Who would you study?**
   - Elite or non-elite participants? Why?
   - How many? What sampling strategy?

2. **Which methods would you use?** (Choose 2-3)
   - Semi-structured interviews?
   - Focus groups (homogeneous/heterogeneous/affinity)?
   - Documents (textual/visual)?
   - Observation (non-participatory/participatory/ethnography)?

]

.pull-right[

3\. **Justify your choices:**
   - Why are these methods appropriate for your question?
   - How would they complement each other?

4\. **Practical challenges:**
   - How would you gain access?
   - What ethical issues might arise?

# Part 3: Analysing Data

---

## General Principles

**Data analysis can take many forms**

Common methods in political science:
1. Content or theme analysis
2. Discourse analysis
3. Frame analysis
4. Dramaturgical analysis

**Key:** Choose method appropriate to your research questions and data type

---

## Content or Theme Analysis

**Definition:** Analysing data in relation to research questions; interpreting social and political meaning

**Materials:**
- Interview transcripts
- Documents (parliamentary transcripts, newspapers)
- Visual images
- Email messages, political speeches

**Evolution:**
- Originally "objective" counting
- Now interpretivist approach
- Focus on meaning, not just patterns

---

## Discourse Analysis

**Definition:** Uncovering how people/groups represent their actions in texts and language

**Core Premise:**
Language is structured according to patterns; these patterns reveal meanings and power relationships

**Focus:**
- How issues are discussed matters
- Texts, talk, visual objects
- Language patterns in different domains

**Applications:**
- Deliberative democracy studies
- Policy analysis
- Understanding perspectives and ideologies

---

## Frame Analysis

**Definition:** Reveals how beliefs, perceptions, and appreciations structure policies and positions

**Three Components:**
1. **Diagnosis** - What is the problem?
2. **Prognosis** - What is the solution?
3. **Call to Action** - Who is responsible? How to solve it?

**Used By:** Political parties, government agencies, social movements (intentionally and strategically)

---

## Bacchi's "What's the Problem Represented to Be?" (WPR)

**Approach:** Pre-defined questions to reveal problem definitions and underlying values

**Example:**
- **Policy:** Language training for migrants
- **Implied problem:** Lack of language knowledge
- **Representation:** Poor integration due to language
- **Alternative frames:** Employment barriers, discrimination, etc.

**Purpose:** Uncover assumptions and whose perspectives are prioritised

---

## The Coding Process

**Seven Key Steps:**

1. **Organise and prepare** - transcribe, sort
2. **Read through all data** - get general sense
3. **Code the data** - bracket chunks, label categories
4. **Identify themes** - group codes into 5-7 themes
5. **Develop story line** - interconnect themes
6. **Add framework** (optional) - apply specific tradition
7. **Represent and interpret** - narratives, visuals, tables

---

## Three Types of Codes

### **Expected Codes**
Based on literature and common sense
- Example: "attitudes toward oneself" in bullying study

### **Surprising Codes**
Unexpected; emerged from data
- Example: "geo-warming impact" in leadership study

### **Unusual/Conceptual Codes**
Of particular interest to readers
- Example: "retriggering" in campus response study

---

## Coding Approaches

**Option 1: Emergent Only**
- Let codes develop naturally
- Traditional in social sciences

**Option 2: Predetermined Only**
- Use theory-based codes
- Popular in health sciences

**Option 3: Combination** (Recommended)
- Start with codebook
- Allow evolution based on data
- Balanced approach

---

# Part 4: Quality

---

## Validity Strategies

**Definition:** Checking for accuracy of findings

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Triangulation** - multiple data sources
2. **Member checking** - participants verify findings
3. **Rich, thick description** - detailed context
4. **Clarify researcher bias** - reflexivity
5. **Prolonged engagement** - extended time in field
6. **Peer debriefing** - outside reviewer

**Recommendation:** Use multiple strategies

---

## Reliability

**Definition:** Consistency across researchers and projects

**Key Strategies:**

1. Check transcripts for accuracy
2. Ensure consistent code definitions
3. Team coordination (documented meetings)
4. Cross-check codes between researchers
5. Intercoder agreement (aim for 80%+)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate consistency and credibility

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Qualitative research** focuses on meaning in context
2. **Three approaches** to generating data: talking, collecting, observing
3. **Multiple analysis methods** available - choose appropriately
4. **Reflexivity** is essential throughout
5. **Quality** requires multiple validity strategies
6. **Innovation** expanding possibilities (online, visual, decolonising)
7. **Systematic approach** - not "anything goes"
