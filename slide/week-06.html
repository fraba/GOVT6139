# Chapter 5

# The Introduction

.center[Slides adapted from Creswell, Research Design 6e, SAGE Publishing, 2023 for GOVT6139 Research Design. Do not reshare]

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Construct** a good abstract for a study with five key components
2. **Describe** reasons for an introduction's role as a key feature of a study
3. **Compare** introductions for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies
4. **Describe** the four components of a good introduction to a study

---

## What is an Introduction?

**Definition**: The first passage in a proposal, journal article, dissertation, or scholarly research study

### Purpose of an Introduction:
- Sets the stage for the entire project
- .content-box-yellow[Establishes the **issue or concern**] leading to the research
- .content-box-yellow[Creates reader interest] in the **problem**
- .content-box-yellow[Places the study within the larger context] of **scholarly literature**
- .content-box-yellow[Reaches out to specific **audiences**]

---

## The Research Problem

**Research Problem**: .content-box-yellow[The **problem or issue** that leads to the need for a study]

### Sources of Research Problems:
- Researchers' personal experiences or workplace situations
- Debates that appear in the academic literature
- Gaps that need to be addressed. But concept of "gaps" is problematic for some...
- ... Instead of gaps in knowledge, others propose to identify areas of "*instability*" in knowledge. 
- Policy debates in government or organisations

### Key Challenge:
- Don't just state what exists in the literature:
- .content-box-green[**identify a problem**] 
  - -&gt; .contentn-box-purple[that **requires a solution**]
  
---

## Critical Perspective: The Problem with Gap-Spotting

### Why Gap-Spotting Dominates Despite Its Limitations
Research shows that **gap-spotting is the overwhelmingly dominant approach** in social sciences, yet it rarely produces the most interesting or influential theories

### The Fundamental Problem:
Gap-spotting tends to **reproduce rather than challenge** the assumptions underlying existing theories. It builds *incrementally* within established frameworks rather than *questioning* foundational assumptions.

### Key Issues:
- **Consensus-seeking vs. Consensus-challenging**: Gap-spotting preserves existing paradigms
- **Incremental additions**: Focuses on "filling gaps" rather than reframing problems
- **Missed opportunities**: Fails to leverage what makes theories truly interesting and influential

.footnote[Source: Alvesson, M., &amp; Sandberg, J. (2024). *Constructing Research Questions: Doing Interesting Research*. SAGE Publications. https://doi.org/10.4135/9781529682588

]

---

## What Makes Research Truly Interesting?

### Davis's Theory of "Interestingness"
Research becomes interesting and influential when it **challenges audience assumptions** about reality - not when it simply adds to existing knowledge

### The Formula:  

**"What seems to be X is in reality non-X"**

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/gaps-vs-instability.png' width = "40%"&gt;]

---

### Examples of Assumption-Challenging Research:
- **Durkheim on Suicide**: Challenged assumption that suicide is individual → showed it's social phenomenon
- **Weber on Protestant Ethics**: Challenged assumption that economy determines religion → argued religion shapes economy
- **Marx on Capitalism**: Challenged assumptions about how economic processes are organised

### The Gap-Spotting Problem:
Despite this knowledge, researchers across **all paradigms** (positivist to poststructuralist) still predominantly use gap-spotting approaches

.footnote[Davis, M. S.1971. That's interesting! Towards a phenomenology of sociology and a sociology of  phenomenology. *Philosophy of Social Sciences*, 1: 309–34]

---

# Task 2: What is the research problem here?

1. Go to the Conversation home page (https://theconversation.com/)
2. Select the "Politics + Society" category (top of the page) or any other category you find interesting
3. Find and read through an article you find interesting.

.center[.content-box-green[

**What is the research problem mentioned or implied in the article?**

]

Remember: The problem (or issue) is what leads to the need for a study.]


4. Post is on Padlet

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://padletcdn.com/cgi/fetch?disposition=attachment&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.padletcdn.com%2Fpadlets%2Fkplnqiw9royh65bt%2Fqr_code.png%3Fsource%3Dimage' width = '20%'&gt;]


---

## The Abstract: Your Study's First Impression

**Abstract**: A brief summary (≈250 words) that allows readers to identify essential elements quickly

### Five Key Components (in order):
1. **Problem/Issue**: Start with the issue under investigation
2. **Data Sources**: Indicate data sources and pertinent characteristics
3. **Method**: State essential features of study design and analysis
4. **Findings**: Convey basic results (with statistics for quantitative)
5. **Implications**: Finish with conclusions and applications

---

## Abstract Example

&gt; "The issue that this study addresses is the lack of women in martial arts competitions. To address this problem, the purpose of this study will be exploring motivation of female athletes in Tae Kwon Do competitions. To gather data, interviews with 4 female Tae Kwon Do tournament competitors were conducted. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed. This data leads to the following 3 themes: social support, self-efficacy, and goal orientation. These themes will be useful for understanding the optimal way to increase motivation in female martial artists."

.center[*What is what here?*]

1. **Problem/Issue**: Start with the issue under investigation
2. **Data Sources**: Indicate data sources and pertinent characteristics
3. **Method**: State essential features of study design and analysis
4. **Findings**: Convey basic results (with statistics for quantitative)
5. **Implications**: Finish with conclusions and applications

---

# Task 3: Identify the 5 components in an abstract of an article published on American Political Science Review 

1. Open the webpage: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review
2. Find an article and open the abstract.
3. Can you see all the components? Something is missing? 

(Keep this article open as we'll use it for the next task...)

---

## Types of Introductions by Research Approach

### Quantitative Introductions
- Focus on understanding **factors or variables** that influence an outcome
- Often seek to **test or improve theory**
- Written from **impersonal point of view** in past tense
- **Structured format** with established patterns

### Qualitative Introductions
- Describe problems best understood by **exploring concepts/phenomena**
- Used when variables, questions, and theory are **unknown**
- May include **personal statements** from researcher
- Written from **personal, subjective point of view**

---

## Mixed Methods Introductions

### Characteristics:
- Can employ **qualitative OR quantitative** approach (or combination)
- May **tip toward one approach** or maintain equal emphasis
- Problem may require both:
  - Understanding relationships among variables (quantitative)
  - Exploring topic in depth (qualitative)

### When to Use Mixed Methods Approach:
- Existing research is primarily one methodology
- Need exists for more inclusive, diverse methodologies

---

## The Deficiencies Model: A Template for Success

**Four-Part Structure** (≈2 pages total, one paragraph each):

1. **State the research problem** (with narrative hook)
2. **Review evidence** from literature justifying the problem
3. **Indicate deficiencies** in the evidence (not necessarily gaps but also "instability" in knowledge)
4. **State importance** of the problem for audiences

---

## Component 1: The Research Problem

### Writing the Opening (Narrative Hook):
**Purpose**: Words that draw, engage, or hook the reader into the study

### Tips for Effective Opening Paragraphs:
- Write an opening sentence that stimulates reader interest
- Refrain from using quotations in the lead sentence
- Stay away from idiomatic expressions
- Consider numeric information for impact
- Clearly identify the research problem
- Cite numerous references to justify importance

---

## Narrative Hook Examples

**Good Examples:**
- *"Who controls the process of chief executive succession?"*
- *"Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer in American society."*

**Metaphor**: Lower the barrel slowly into the well
- **Inexperienced writer**: Plunges reader into unfamiliar depths
- **Experienced writer**: Slowly lowers reader, allowing acclimatization

---

# Task 4: 

1. Go back to the abstract you selected for the previous task https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review
2. Check the first paragraph of the actual article (not the abstract)
3. Does it follow these tips?

.content-box-yellow[

- Write an opening sentence that stimulates reader interest
- Refrain from using quotations in the lead sentence
- Stay away from idiomatic expressions
- Consider numeric information for impact
- Clearly identify the research problem
- Cite numerous references to justify importance

]







---

## Component 2: Evidence from Literature

### Purpose:
- **Justify** the study's importance
- Create **distinctions** between past studies and proposed one
- Set research problem within **ongoing dialogue** in literature

### Guidelines:
- Review **groups of studies**, not individual ones
- Focus on **empirical articles** (quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods), but is might also be useful to use **review articles**
- Use **recent literature** (past 10 years)
- Place in-text references at end of paragraphs to deemphasize single studies

---

## Component 3: Deficiencies in Evidence

### Types of Deficiencies:
- Topics unexplored with particular **groups/populations**
- Need for **replication** due to mixed results
- **Underrepresented voices** not heard in literature
- Methodological limitations or gaps
- **Unstable** knowledge or understanding about some phenomenon

### Finding Deficiencies:
- Examine **"future research" sections** of published studies
- Look for **limitations** mentioned by authors
- Identify **overlooked variables** or populations
- Identify **unsatisfactory explanations**

---

## Deficiencies by Research Type

### Qualitative Research:
- Special populations not explored
- New sites not investigated
- Underrepresented groups not given voice
- Lack of interview/observation data

### Quantitative Research:
- Inadequate theory development
- Invalid or unreliable measures
- Inattention to mediating variables

---

### Mixed Methods:
- Lack of integrated quantitative/qualitative data
- Missing insights from database connections

---

## Component 4: Importance for Audiences

### Purpose:
- Create clear **rationale** for study importance
- Help readers understand **wide applicability**
- Demonstrate **multiple benefits**

### Include:
- **3-4 reasons** study adds to or improves scholarly research/literature
- **Several reasons** how study helps improve practice
- **Multiple reasons** why study will improve policy/decision-making

---

## Putting It All Together: Complete Example

**Study**: "Exploring the Conceptions and Misconceptions of Teen Smoking in High Schools"

1. **Problem**: Tobacco use causes cancer; adolescent smoking increasing
2. **Literature**: Four primary research areas identified
3. **Deficiencies**: Minimal attention to high school social context
4. **Audiences**: Benefits researchers, administrators, school officials

---

## Writing Tips and Best Practices for Your Introduction

### Do:
- Start with broad, accessible opening
- Use clear, concrete language
- Maintain logical flow between sections
- Cite multiple sources to establish credibility
- End with clear contribution statement

### Don't:
- Use long quotations in opening
- Rely on idiomatic expressions
- Simply state facts without identifying problems
- Replicate exactly what others have done

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Stating facts instead of problems**
   - Wrong: "Teenage pregnancy is prevalent"
   - Right: "Schools have done poor job accommodating pregnant teenagers"

2. **Unclear problem identification**
   - Readers must decide importance for themselves

3. **Confusing research problem with research questions**
   - Problem = issue requiring solution
   - Questions = specific queries answered by data
   
---

## Key Distinctions Research Problem vs Research Questions

| Research Problem | Research Question |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Describes an **issue or concern** | Poses a **specific question** (i.e. it ends with a question mark!) |
| States **what's wrong** or **what needs attention** | Asks **what you want to find out** |
| Justifies **why** study is needed | Guides **what data** to collect |
| Often uses phrases like "concern," "challenge," "lack of," "threatens" | Often starts with "What," "How," "Why," "To what extent" |
| Creates the **need** for research | Directs the **focus** of research |

---

## Quality Checklist

### Strong Introduction Should:
- [ ] Hook reader with compelling opening
- [ ] Clearly state research problem
- [ ] Justify problem with substantial literature
- [ ] Identify specific gaps/deficiencies
- [ ] Address multiple audiences
- [ ] End with contribution statement
- [ ] Maintain consistency with research approach

---

## Summary

### The Deficiencies Model Provides:
1. **Structured approach** to writing introductions
2. **Clear template** applicable across research approaches
3. **Logical progression** from problem to contribution
4. **Audience-focused** rationale for study importance

### Remember:
- Introduction sets stage for entire project
- First impressions matter in scholarly writing
- Strong introduction encourages continued reading
- Template can be adapted for any research approach

---

## Next Steps

### Practice Activities:
1. Draft narrative hooks for your research topic
2. Write one-page introduction using deficiencies model
3. Identify gaps in or issues with literature related to your study
4. Examine "future research" sections in published articles

### Key Takeaway:
A well-crafted introduction using the deficiencies model creates compelling justification for your research and draws readers into your scholarly contribution.
