# Quantitative Research Questions and Hypotheses

## Quantitative Research Questions and Hypotheses

.content-box-yellow[
* Quantitative **research questions**

  * About the **relationships among variables** that the investigator seeks to know
]
 
.content-box-red[ 
* Quantitative **hypotheses**

  * **Predictions** about the expected relationships among variables
  
  * **Estimates** of population values based on data from a sample
]
---

## Quantitative research question describing outcomes

&gt; What is the frequency and variation of scores on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (name the variable) for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (participants) in the study?


* How could we fill the blanks?

--

.content-box-yellow[
What is the frequency and variation of scores on ***standardised test performance*** for ***high school students*** in the study?
]


---

## Quantitative research question focused on examining the relationship among variables

&gt; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (name the theory) posits that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (explain relationships between variables). It is thus predicted that there will be a relationship between \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (predictor variable) and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (outcome variable), such that (explain the direction of the effect between the predictor and outcome variable).

* How could we fill the blanks?

--

.content-box-yellow[
**Social Learning Theory** posits that individuals learn behaviors and norms through observing others and the consequences that others face. It is thus predicted that there will be a relationship between **exposure to aggressive behavior in media** and **aggressive behavior in children**, such that the more children are exposed to aggressive behavior in media, the more likely they are to exhibit aggressive behaviors themselves.
]

---

## Quantitative null hypothesis

&gt; There is no significant difference between \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (the control and experimental groups on the independent variable) on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (dependent variable).

* How could we fill the blanks?

--

.content-box-yellow[
There is no significant difference between ***the control and experimental groups on the use of traditional vs. innovative teaching methods*** on ***student engagement levels***.
]

---

## Three basic approaches (within the quantitative approach)

1. Describe responses
2. Relate variables (e.g., multivariate analysis)
3. Compare groups (practically similar to 2., as *group* is an additional independent variable)

.content-box-red[
* Most rigorous form **tests a theory**
* Measure the **independent** and **dependent** variables separately
* Write **questions** or **hypotheses**
* Null and *alternative* **hypotheses**
]

---

## The use of variables in research questions or hypothesis if one wants to do

1. A **descriptive** study
2. A survey that **correlates** variables
3. An experiment or group comparisons (again, practially similar to 2.)

* Wait, what do we mean by **correlation**? 

--

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation_2x.png' width = '60%'&gt;]

---

Two variables:

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/correlation_2x.png' width = '70%'&gt;]

* **Taking a statistics class**: `\(x \in \{0, 1\}\)` (with `\(0=No\)` and `\(1=Yes\)`)
* **Knowing that correlation doesn't imply causation**: `\(y \in \{0, 1\}\)`

--

The variables are correlated because I observe .content-box-green[ `\(x=0\)` AND `\(y=0\)`] OR .content-box-red[ `\(x=1\)` AND `\(y=1\)`].

--

BUT, what about causation `\(x \rightarrow y\)`? *Maybe*, as we have a good theory to explain it (but no statistical certainty).



---

## If writing hypotheses, use a consistent form

* **Null hypotheses** (predict *no difference* or no relationship)
* **Alternative hypothesis** (predict *significant relationship* between variables)
* Use **directional words** ( `\(\rightarrow\)` ) of quantitative research:
  * Affect, influence, predict, impact, determine, cause, and relate
  
Just remember that directionality (i.e., causality) is determined through theory (or design if you run a controlled experiment), not from statistical analysis. 

.center[**Statistical analysis produces correlation estimates but never determines the certainty causal relationships.**&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]

.footnote[[1] Yes we do have causal inference methods and casual diagrams, but that's a story for another time...]

# Task 1: Questions, Hypotheses and Variables

Yang, T. Z. (2025). Normalization of Censorship: Evidence from China. *The Journal of Politics*, 87(4), 1227‚Äì1242. https://doi.org/10.1086/734239 [USyd link](https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/2rsddf/cdi_proquest_journals_3249289364)

&gt; Authoritarian censorship is traditionally understood as a repressive tool and will cause public backlash against the regime. However, surveys worldwide consistently find that citizens in authoritarian regimes are apathetic toward or even supportive of government censorship. To explain this puzzle, I theorize that citizens are subject to a normalization process. Specifically, individuals become desensitized to censorship activities when the range of censored content expands beyond politically threatening topics, like government criticism and collective action, to other less political issues. Using 28 million censored articles and two original survey experiments in China, I show that (1) a majority of censored articles are indeed unrelated to politically threatening topics, and (2) respondents exposed to the censorship of both political and nonpolitical content report higher support for censorship and the regime than those exposed only to political censorship. These findings highlight how normalizing repressive apparatuses like censorship contributes to authoritarian control and survival.

# Qualitative Research Questions

## Qualitative Research Questions

### Qualitative researchers pose research questions

* Not objectives
* Not hypotheses

### Two forms of qualitative research questions

1. **Central question**

  * Broad question that asks for exploration of the central phenomenon
  
2. **Sub-questions**

  * Questions that narrow the focus of the study

---

### Ask 1‚Äì2 central research questions

  * Broad and ask for exploration of the **central phenomenon** or concept
  
  * Explore the general, **complex factors** about to the central phenomenon
  
  * Present **broad perspectives** or **meanings**

### No more than 5‚Äì7 sub-questions these will narrow the focus but leave open the questioning

* **Relate the central question** to the strategy of inquiry

  * **Ethnography** ‚Äì culture sharing group, questions verify accuracy of data
  
  * **Critical ethnography** ‚Äì build on an existing literature
  
  * **Phenomenology** ‚Äì what participants experienced
  
  * **Grounded theory** ‚Äì generate a theory (from observation)

---

## In formulating a qualitative research question...

* Begin with **WHAT** or **HOW** to convey an open or emerging design

* Focus on a **single phenomenon** or concept

* Use exploratory verbs: report, describe, discover, seek, explore, describe

## Expect questions to evolve and change

* Use **open-ended questions** without reference to the literature or theory (unless indicated)

* Specify the participants and research site

---

## Qualitative central question

&gt; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (How or what?) is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (central phenomenon) for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (participants) at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (research site).

* Can you fill in the blanks?

--

**How** is **job satisfaction experienced** for **faculty members** at **a university**.

## Qualitative central question (Example 7.5 from the textbook)

&gt; How do participants engage in an intergenerational playgroup (IGP) within the context of a residential aged care facility (RACF)? 

&lt;br/&gt;

.content-box-yellow[

What is the central phenomenon investigated here?

---

## Qualitative subquestions

&gt; Sub-questions serve to sub-divide the central question‚Äôs phenomenon in narrower questions. Often these sub-questions become the key questions in interviews or observations (Creswell &amp; B√†ez, 2020). 

&gt; An example from Creswell and B√†ez takes the central phenomenon of diversity and looks at it from the perspective of the entire campus and classes and with personnel (administration, campus police).

#### Central question: What is the campus climate toward diversity?

Sub-questions:

* What are students‚Äô **attitudes** on campus toward forming diverse social groups?
* How is diversity **encouraged** by the central administration?
* How is diversity **encouraged** in the undergraduate classes on campus?
* How is diversity **encouraged** by the campus police force?

## Mixed Methods Research Questions and Hypotheses

.pull-left[

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/mixed-methods-researcher.webp' width = '55%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

]

.pull-right[


* Include qualitative, quantitative (or hypotheses), and a mixed methods research question

* Qualitative and quantitative questions focus the purpose

* Mixed methods question conveys the **importance of integrating**

* Use guidelines for qualitative and quantitative questions and hypotheses

]

---

## Order questions to match the mixed methods design

  * In a single-phase design, either first (qualitative or quantitative)
  
  * In a two-phase design, order to match the phases
  
  * In three-phase, often mixed methods in the middle

---

## A  __mixed methods research question __ directly addresses integration

Mixed methods question:

&gt; The mixed methods question in the study purpose or  _intent _ will be to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (compare, explain, build, augment) the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (quantitative data or qualitative data or process/framework) with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (quantitative data or qualitative data) by using a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (design: convergent design, explanatory sequential design, exploratory sequential design, embedded design) with the  _procedure _ of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (merging, connecting, or embedding).


---

### Example 7.8 Research Questions in a Mixed Methods Study

DeCoito and Estaiteyeh (2022) focused their study on science/STEM **teachers‚Äô experiences with online teaching and learning** in a Canadian province. They **explored curriculum planning quantitatively** and **assessment strategies both quantitatively and qualitatively**. Their intent was to combine the results of both databases. They further examined the impact of online teaching on student outcomes (student engagement, student‚Äìteacher engagement, and student achievement).

* **What digital tools and resources** were teachers using in an online environment? .content-box-yellow[(a descriptive, quantitative question)]
* **What strategies** did teachers‚Äô online curriculum development and implementation embrace? .content-box-yellow[(a descriptive, quantitative question)]
* **What models** of student assessment did the teachers implement online? .content-box-yellow[(a descriptive, quantitative question supported by participants‚Äô qualitative experiences‚Äîa mixed methods question)]
* **What were the impacts** of online teaching on students‚Äô outcomes as observed by teachers? .content-box-yellow[(a quantitative question)]
