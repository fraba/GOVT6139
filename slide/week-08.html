# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop

### Part 1: 5-minute project presentation (45 minutes)

- Prepare to present your research proposal in five minutes.

- You are encouraged to preliminary share supporting materials using the [Canvas Group](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Groups/ta-p/16) page for Week 12 (e.g. a one or two slide deck, or a one-page document). 

- In groups of four, each student will present for five minutes - I will be strict with the timing - and then receive questions and comments for another five minutes.

- You are encouraged to keep discussing this on the Canvas groups page after class.

---

# Week 12: Peer feedback workshop

### Part 2: Brain storm on the issues you have identified with the presentations you reviewed (30 minutes)

- Prepare a (short) list of issues to discuss with your group (but avoid offering details that could identify the proposal you have reviewed). 

- In the same groups of four, discuss the issues and possible solutions for about 20 minutes.

- Report on your discussion using Padlet (same as before, avoid offering details that could identify specific proposals): list issues and possible solutions.

# Introduction to quantitative methods

---

## Quantitative methods mostly draws upon positivist

Key assumptions:

**Foundationalist ontology**

- The world exists independently of our observations

- There is an ultimate and knowable truth

**Positivist epistemology**

- Can establish ‚Äòreal‚Äô relationships between social phenomena

- Can study these relationships via observation

- Objective (researcher‚Äôs interpretation should not determine the results)

- Interested in generalisability and causality

---

## Types of quantitative data in political science

**Primary and Secondary Data**

- Collected by the researcher (primary)

- Collected by someone else (secondary)

1. Surveys
    - Data on individual attitudes and reported behaviors

2. Country-level data
    - Economic conditions
    - Measures of how democratic a country is

3. Content analysis
    - E.g. coding newspaper articles, social media posts

4. Data from Experiments
    - Survey, lab or field experiments

---

## Why use quantitative methods?

#### Generalizability
- Results can be representative of the population studied (if designed to be)
- Comparability, e.g. comparisons cross-nationally, between states, over time, across sub-groups - by gender, race, age-group etc.

#### Assessing relationships between variables
- Are two variables related?
- e.g. are young people less satisfied with democracy?
- Does X cause Y?
- e.g. did frequent changes of Prime Minister cause Australians to become less satisfied with democracy?

#### Scope
- Possible to be broad in scope, can look at a whole country, or even comparisons across many countries.
- Can do large-N research using quantitative methods ‚Äì that wouldn‚Äôt be feasible using qualitative methods.

## 2.	Asking survey questions

## 3. Selecting a sample

## 4. Sample size

---

## 1.	What is a survey

---

## 1.	What is a survey

#### Definition
Data collection tool used to gather information about individuals
It takes a sample of a larger population, asking questions, and recording the answers
Note: Unit of Analysis = individuals
#### Purpose
To collect original data for describing a population too large to observe directly
#### What do Survey Researchers do?
Sample many respondents who answer the same questions;
They then analyse the data to look at:
- Average responses to survey questions
- Relationships between variables (e.g. age group and attitudes towards democracy)
- Test theories and hypotheses about attitudes / behaviours

---

## Surveys vs Interviews

#### Fundamental differences

- A survey research (or ‚Äúpolling‚Äù) takes a sample of the population, asks questions, records the answers, and examines the distribution of answers.
- An interview research focuses on specific individuals (e.g., government officers), ask questions, record the answers, and examine the opinions and attitudes of specific individuals.

#### Stylistic differences

- In survey research, each respondent is treated equally, but in an interview, each interviewee is usually treated differently.
- The sequence of questions is pre-determined in survey research, but can be flexibly modified in an interview research.
- Most questions are close-ended in survey research, but are open-ended in an interview research.
- Surveys are usually analyzed with statistics, interviews are usually interpreted qualitatively.

---

## How do we go about survey research?

1. Developing a survey questionnaire

2. Selecting a sample (who / how many?)

3. Selecting a survey mode (e.g. phone / mail / online / in- person)

4. Field the survey

5. Analyse the data (After the break!)

---

## 2.	Asking survey questions

#### Open vs. Closed Questions
- Closed: Respondents are given all of the possible answers (mostly used in surveys)
- Open: Respondents are given a more general question and asked to articulate their own answers (often used in interviews)

#### Writing good survey questions
- Keep it clear and avoid confusion
- Keep the respondent‚Äôs perspective in mind
- Give the researcher valid measures (does the concept match the measure?)

#### Other considerations
- How many questions?
- Consistency in question wording: to enable comparisons between countries / over time.

---

## Asking survey questions: Things to Avoid

- Avoid jargon, slang, abbreviations
- Avoid ambiguity, confusion, and vagueness
- Avoid emotional language
- Avoid double-barreled questions (two or more questions bound together)
- Avoid leading questions
- Avoid asking questions that are beyond respondent‚Äôs capabilities
- Avoid asking about future intentions
- Avoid double negatives
- Avoid overlapping or unbalanced response categories

---

## Example survey question: Is this a good question?

&gt; Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "The federal government has gotten totally out of control and threatens our basic liberties unless we clear house and commit to drastic change"

--

Problems with the question:

--

- Double (or triple/quadruple) barreled question

--

- Emotional language

--

- Vagueness / ambiguity ‚Äì e.g. what do they mean by ‚Äòclear house‚Äô and ‚Äòdrastic change‚Äô

---

## Example survey question: Is this a good question?

&gt; How serious a threat do you think global warming will pose to you or your way of life in your lifetime? 
&gt; 1. Very serious
&gt; 2. Farily serious
&gt; 3. Not very serious
&gt; 4. Not at all serious

## Example survey question: Is this a good question?

&lt;img src = '../img/wvs-question.jpg' width = '100%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;


(Source: World Values Survey 2012)

---

## What questions do we put in our survey?

#### Theory testing

Example: Are young people less interested in politics?

- **Independent variable** (the presumed cause): Age
- **Dependent variable** (the presumed effect): Interest in politics
- **Control variables**: e.g. education level, gender

&lt;mark&gt;We‚Äôd ask questions about our variables of interest to be able to examine the relationship between variables&lt;/mark&gt;

---

## What questions do we put in our survey?

#### How many questions to ask?

- Common to include questions that will be relevant for many researchers in the one survey

- More questions = more variables = more that can be done with the data

- However, the longer the questionnaire, the more likely some respondents might not complete the survey

---

## 3. Selecting a sample

---

## Sampling: Who is asked to complete the survey?

#### Rationale
- Making inferences about a population from a sample
#### Terminology
- Population; Sampling Frame; Sample
#### Sample Designs
- Probability Samples
- Non-Probability Samples

---

## What is a sample

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Simple_random_sampling.PNG' width = '90%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## What is a sample? Example

#### Population: 

- Every student in GOVT6139

#### Sample: 

Each and every group we created for the in-class tasks

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Simple_random_sampling.PNG' width = '50%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## How do we go from population to sample? The Sampling frame

- To select a sample from our population we first need a sampling frame
- The sampling frame is the list of all the units (e.g. people) in the population
- Ideally, the sampling frame would be a list of every member of the population, e.g.
    - List of all adults in Australia
    - List of all uni students at USYD
    - List of all students in GOVT6139
- In reality this isn‚Äôt always possible
 - Need list as close to the population as possible, e.g.:
 - List of enrolled voters
 - List of phone numbers
 - List of addresses

---

# Once we have our sampling frame, who do we select to be part of the sample?

#### Probability Samples
Those within the sampling frame have an equal chance of being selected into the sample
- Simple random sample (this is the gold standard)
- Modifications (e.g. cluster sampling, systematic, stratified)
- **Can make inferences to the population**

#### Non-probability Samples
Those within the sampling frame have a non-equal chance of being selected into the sample
- Convenience sample / street corner sample
- Online ‚Äòopt-in‚Äô surveys
- **Cannot make inferences to the population**

---

## Simple random sample

1. Probability sample

2. List of the population (sampling frame)

3. Assign a number to everyone in the list

4. Randomly select numbers (e.g. via random number generator)

**Those randomly selected are your sample**

---

### Note on terminology: Random selection vs. random assignment

#### Random selection
- ‚ÄòRefers to the process of randomly selection individuals from a population to be involved in a study.
- Used in survey research to obtain a sample representative of the population of interest

#### Random assignment
- ‚ÄòRefers to the process of randomly assigning the individuals in a study to either a treatment group or a control group.‚Äô
- Used in experimental research to ensure the treatment and control group will be the same.

## Cluster Sampling

.pull-left[

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Simple_random_sampling.PNG' width = '100%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

]

.pull-right[

- Probability sample

- Randomly select clusters (e.g. districts within the United States)

- Within the selected clusters, randomly select people to be included in the sample

*Why/when would we use this approach instead of a simple random sample?*

- If doing a face to face survey in a large country (e.g. Australia / USA) more feasible ‚Äì cost/time.


]

---

## Non-probability sample

- Non-random selection into sample

- E.g. online opt-in survey ‚Äì why isn‚Äôt this ideal?

- E.g. street corner sample ‚Äì why isn‚Äôt this ideal?


**Cannot make inferences to the population from a non- probability sample**

---

## 4. Sample size

---

## How many people do we select to be part of our sample?

#### Law of large numbers

‚Äì	 The larger your sample size, the closer the sample mean (average) will be to the population mean (but only *if the sample is a random sample*)

‚Äì	What happens if we flip a coin once, ten times, 100 times, 1000 times?

#### Law of large numbers

&lt;img src="week-08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Sample size and margin of error

If your sampling is truly random, you should expect this trend:

* The larger the sample, the narrower the confidence interval (i.e. the expected precision of your result)

* Yet, with a diminishing benefit: at a certain point, increasing your sample size will stop capturing significantly more diversity of your population.
