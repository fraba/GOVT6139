# Any question concerning the content for this week?

---

# A few more words about participation in class

* *Attend* & *Engage*

* Some students are comfortable in speaking up in class, others less

* Engagement can take different forms

* If you are *not comfortable* in speaking up during class, you should alternatively:

  * Post your comments using Padlet (make sure to add your name);
  
  * Post your comments/questions about the content using the discussion board on Canvas
  
  * Email me your comments or questions. 
  
(Also, if would really help me if you could add a photo of yourself through Canvas "Setting the scene" -> "Knowing you better")

## Chapter 1 Learning Objectives

1. Define major research terms used in this book so that you can incorporate them into your projects.

2. Describe the three major methodologies and their differences to select an appropriate methodology for your study.

3. Describe the relationship among the terms, philosophical worldview assumptions, designs, and methods. How would you connect these three components in your study?

4. Appraise which one of the philosophical worldviews fits your experiences, training, and cultural orientation.

5. Identify which one of the types of research designs you will use in your study.

6. Describe the differences between quantitative methods, qualitative methods, and mixed methods research.

7. Identify the reasons for choosing either a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approach to use in your study.

## Introducing Key Terms in this Chapter

**Research approaches** – plans and the procedures for research that span the steps

**Research designs** – procedures for inquiry

**Research methods** – specific data collection, analysis, and interpretation methods

**Research problem** – issue being addressed

---

The book uses three key terms throughout: **Research approaches**, **research designs**, and **research methods**. They represent the perspective about research from broad constructions of research to the narrow procedures of methods.


__Table 1.1: Key Terms and Their Definitions as Used in This Chapter__

| Key Terms | Definitions |
| :-: | :-: |
| Philosophical Assumptions | Before a study begins, a researcher brings a point of view and a set of beliefs to the research process that informs their approach to conducting the study. Philosophical assumptions are these *beliefs* and *values*. They emphasize what the researcher holds to be most important in conducting a study. Philosophical assumptions develop from an individual’s training in a specific discipline or field of study (e.g., political sciences). They also emerge from prior experiences in research and the cultural environment of an individual.	<br /> |
| Research Approach | We will use the term research approach synonymously with *research methodology*. This term represents different types of research to have historically emerged. In this chapter, we will present three broad methodologies: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods.	<br /> |

---

__Table 1.1: Key Terms and Their Definitions as Used in This Chapter (continued)__

| Key Terms | Definitions |
| :-: | :-: |
| Research Design | We use the term research design to mean the ways of conducting research within a broad methodology. Thus, as seen in this chapter, broad methodologies can be subdivided into different types of designs. Each design has its own procedures used in conducting a study. <br /> |
| Research Methods | Within a particular design, the researcher gathers data, analyzes it, and makes an interpretation of its meaning. These are the methods in a study.	<br /> |

# Three Approaches or Methodologies in Research

## 

## Qualitative

## Quantitative

## Mixed methods

---

## Qualitative research

* Focuses on *understanding meaning*

* Uses emerging questions

* Collects data in participant’s setting

* Uses an **inductive** approach to analysis

* Has a written report that is flexible in structure

---

## Quantitative research

* *Tests objective theories*

* Examines relationships among measurable variables

* Uses survey instruments that produce numbered data

* Uses statistical analysis of data generated

* Tests theories **deductively**

* Uses a set structure for the final report

---

## Mixed methods research

* Collects both quantitative and qualitative data

* Integrates the two forms of data

* Uses distinct designs that may involve philosophy or theory

* Yields additional insight to a research problem

---

## Two types of reasoning: Induction and deduction

### Relationship between observations (evidence) and theory

## Philosophical worldviews

## Research designs

## Research methods

---

### Let's examing the Philosophical Assumpytions or Worlviews now...

```{r echo = F, out.width='100%'}

require(DiagrammeR)

grViz("                           # All instructions are within a large character string

## Philosophical Worldviews

* Beliefs about the world and nature of research

* Make explicit in proposal

* Four common worldviews:

  * Postpositivism
  
  * Constructivism
  
  * Transformative
  
  * Pragmatism

---

__Table 1.2: Four Worldviews__

| Postpositivism | Constructivism | Transformative | Pragmatism |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| <br />Determination<br />Reductionism<br />Empirical observation and measurement<br />Theory verification<br />	<br /> | <br />Understanding<br />Multiple participant meanings<br />Social and historical construction<br />Theory development | <br />Political<br />Power and justice oriented<br />Collaborative<br />Change oriented<br /> | <br />Consequences of action<br />Problem centered<br />Pluralistic<br />Real-world practice oriented<br /> |

* Qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods

* Provides specific direction for procedures

* Types of designs have grown
