# Introduction


---

# Introduction

## Mixed methods procedure

* Combining qualitative and quantitative forms for more understanding

* Limitations and strengths of each type of data collection

* Nature of mixed methods

* Reasons to use

---

# Characteristics of Mixed Methods Research

## The mixed methods researcher:

1. Collects two types of data‚Äî _qualitative (open-ended)_  _ and _  _quantitative (closed- ended) _ data‚Äîto study the research problem or question

2. Connects the two data sets, called  _integration_

3. Uses procedures to integrate the two data sets, called a  _mixed methods design_

4. Analyses integration typically in a table, called a  _joint display_ , by representing the two databases together in the procedures

5. Draws conclusions, insight, or interpretation from the integration analysis, called  _metainferences_

6. Frames the study with the researcher‚Äôs beliefs, values (**worldview**), and explanations drawn from the literature (**theories**)

---

# Justification for Using Mixed Methods Research

## Reasons for choosing mixed methods

* Developing a **complete understanding** of a research problem by combining **quantitative** and **qualitative** results

* Explaining quantitative results in detail with qualitative descriptions

* Improving measures, scales, and instruments

But also, 

* Augmenting experiments

* Developing cases

* Evaluating programs

* Understanding changes needed for marginalized group

---

# Definitions of Mixed Methods Terms

### Open-ended data

* Information gathered where researchers ask a question but do not provide a response option
  
  * E.g., Participants share views, researcher records them
    
* Information gathered when researchers provide a qualitative description of a document (sociql media post)
    
### Closed-ended data

* Information gathered where the researcher provides participants with response options
  
  * E.g., Rating scales (likert)
    
* Information generated classifying a document's topic (like a media post) using software 

---

# Research Design

## Procedure used in conducting a study

Two categories:  **core designs** and  **complex designs**

### Core Designs

Designs found in all mixed methods studies including convergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs

### Complex Designs

Primary intent not simply integration of two databases but to have mixed methods  _support _ the procedures of a process or framework


---

# More key terminology for mixed-methods research

### Integration

* Central concept in mixed methods research

* Involves combining in a study or a series of studies information from qualitative and quantitative data

### Joint Display

* Table or graph that presents side-by-side combination of two combined databases
  
### Metainferences

* Insights that emerge as researcher compares the quantitative and qualitative databases

---

# The Process of Conducting a Mixed Methods Study

## Connecting the quantitative and qualitative data to a specific type of mixed methods design

1. Researcher draws a diagram of the design

2. Integrates the two databases

3. Presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis

4. Draws insights or **metainferences** from results of the integration

# Core Mixed Methods Designs

---

# Core Mixed Methods Designs

## Three core mixed methods designs

1. **Convergent** design (One-phase design)

2. **Explanatory** sequential design (Two-phase design)

3. **Exploratory** sequential design  (Three-phase design)

---

__Figure 10.2: Three Core Designs__

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/Creswellrd6e_PPT102.jpg' width = '80%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

# The Convergent Mixed Methods Design

* __Intent:__  to  _compare _ results from the qualitative databases with results from the quantitative databases by  _merging _ the results
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative and qualitative data provide different types of information
* Most familiar approach
* Description of the design
  * Collects both quantitative and qualitative data,
  * Analyzes them separately,
  * Compares the results to see if the findings confirm or disconfirm each other

---

# The Convergent Mixed Methods Design

### Data collection

* Use the same or parallel variables, constructs, or concepts

### Data analysis and integration

* Analyse qualitative database
* Analyse quantitative database
* Integrate the two
* __Joint display__  ‚Äì merge forms of data in a single visual display (Table 10.2)

---

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/Creswellrd6e_PPT102.jpg' width = '80%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

# The Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

* __Intent:__  to  _explain _ initial quantitative _ _ results with  results from qualitative data by  _connecting _ the two databases
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative results may yield  _surprising _ information that needs  _explanation_
* Description of the design
  * Involves a two-phase project
  * Collection of quantitative data in the first phase
  * Uses results to plan the second, qualitative phase
  * Qualitative data help in explain in more detail the initial quantitative results

---

# The Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

### Data collection

* Two distinct phases

* Rigorous quantitative sampling and purposeful qualitative

### Data analysis and integration

* Connecting quantitative results to qualitative data collection
  
* Quantitative results inform sampling and qualitative questions to ask

# The Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

* __Intent:__  to  _explore _ how qualitative data can improve quantitative measures, scales, or instruments
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative results may yield  _surprising _ information that needs  _explanation_
* Description of the design
  * A three-phase design
  * Start with a qualitative phase
  * Build to a feature to be tested (e.g., survey instrument)
  * Followed by a quantitative phase that tests the feature

---

# The Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

### Data collection

* Initial qualitative data collection

* Test of quantitative feature

### Integrative data analysis

* Analyse the two databases separately

* Use the findings from the initial exploratory database to build into a feature

* Qualitative findings inform design of quantitative phase (e.g., instrument, variables)

---

# The Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

# Complex Mixed Methods Designs

---

# Complex Mixed Methods Designs

* All mixed methods studies have at least one  **core design** (e.g., convergent, explanatory sequential, or exploratory sequential)

* **Complex designs** have core designs embedded in frameworks larger than simply collecting, analysing, and integrating quantitative and qualitative data

---

# Types of Complex Designs

Several complex mixed methods designs:


* Intersecting a secondary method (mixed methods) within a primary quantitative or qualitative design (e.g., an intervention)

* Intersecting mixed methods within another methodology (e.g., evaluation)

* Intersecting mixed methods within a theoretical framework (e.g., social justice)

---

# Examples of Complex Designs

__Mixed methods experimental (intervention) design__  ‚Äì quantitative and qualitative data within an experiment or trial (Figure 10.3)

__Mixed methods case study design__  ‚Äì mixed methods within a single or multiple case study (Figure 10.4)

__Mixed methods participatory social justice design__  ‚Äì core mixed methods design within a larger framework (Figure 10.5)

__Mixed methods evaluation design__  ‚Äì one or more core designs in an evaluation (Figure 10.6)

# Incorporating Core Designs into Complex Designs

* Identify quantitative and qualitative data collection

* Draw a diagram of steps

* Look in steps for opportunities to collect quantitative and qualitative data

* Examine how databases are connected

* Discuss overall framework or process and the embedded core designs

---

## Factors Important in Choosing a Mixed Methods Design

### Choice based on intent and procedures

1. **Integration statement**

&gt; Integration involved comparing the results from the quantitative and qualitative data by merging so that a more complete understanding emerges than provided by the quantitative or the qualitative results alone.‚Äù (convergent design example)

2\. **Design intent**
  
3\. **Select procedures that match design**

---

__Table 10.5: Intent and Procedures of Mixed Methods Designs__

| Mixed Methods Design | Intent or Purpose (of mixing the two databases) | Procedure (for conducting the research) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Convergent Design | Compare, Match, Corroborate (Validate), Expand, Enhance, Diffract, Identify Cases, Initiating, Complete Understanding | Merge (putting the databases side-by-side) |
| Explanatory Sequential Design | Expand, Explain | Connect (quantitative results connection with qualitative data collection) |
| Exploratory Sequential Design | Build Upon, Transfer, Generalize | Connect (qualitative results lead to design of quantitative assessment that is then tested) |
| Complex Mixed Methods Design | Augment (optimize, ascertain needs, monitor) | Add into a process/ framework&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qualitative, Quantitative, or Both Types of Data |

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/Creswellrd6e_PPT108.jpg' width = "60%"&gt;&lt;img&gt;]

---

## Other Reasons for Choosing a Design

### Choice based on

* Popular designs in a field or discipline

* Single researcher or team

* Choice by advisors or mentors

* Timing in mixed methods data collection ‚Äì convergent or sequential

* Emphasis placed on each database ‚Äì equal or unequal
