# Characteristics of Mixed Methods Research

* The mixed methods researcher:
  * Collects two types of data‚Äî _qualitative (open-ended)_  _ and _  _quantitative (closed- ended) _ data‚Äîto study the research problem or question
  * Connects the two data sets, called  _integration_
  * Uses procedures to integrate the two data sets, called a  _mixed methods design_
  * Analyzes integration typically in a table, called a  _joint display_ , by representing the two databases together in the procedures
  * Draws conclusions, insight, or interpretation from the integration analysis, called  _metainferences_
  * Frames the study with the researcher‚Äôs beliefs, values  __(__  _worldview_  __)__ , and explanations drawn from the literature  __(__  _theories_  __)__

---

# Justification for Using Mixed Methods Research

* Reasons for choosing mixed methods
  * Developing a complete understanding of a research problem by combining quantitative and qualitative results
  * Explaining quantitative results in detail with qualitative
  * Improving measures, scales, and instruments
  * Augmenting experiments
  * Developing cases
  * Evaluating programs
  * Understanding changes needed for marginalized group

---

# Definitions of Mixed Methods Terms (1 of 3)

* __Open-ended data__
  * Information gathered where researchers ask a question by do not provide a response option
    * Participants share views, researcher records them
* __Closed-ended data__
  * Information gathered where the researcher provides participants with response options
    * Rating scales

---

* __Research Design	__
  * Procedure used in conducting a study
  * Two categories:  _core designs _ and  _complex designs_
  * __Core Designs__
    * Designs found in all mixed methods studies including convergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs
  * __Complex Designs__
    * Primary intent not simply integration of two databases but to have mixed methods  _support _ the procedures of a process or framework
    * Experimental processes, participatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, evaluation processes

---

* __Integration__
  * Central concept in mixed methods research
  * Involves combining in a study or a series of studies information from qualitative and quantitative data
* __Joint Display__
  * Table or graph that presents side-by-side combination of two combined databases
* __Metainferences__
  * Insights that emerge as researcher compares the quantitative and qualitative databases

---

# The Process of Conducting a Mixed Methods Study

* Connecting the quantitative and qualitative data to a specific type of mixed methods design
  * Researcher draws a diagram of the design
  * Integrates the two databases
  * Presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis
  * Draws insights or metainferences from results of the integration

---

# Quantitative and Qualitative Data Collection

* Indicate types of qualitative and quantitative data collected; one needs a clear sense of types of data gathered
* If both quantitative and qualitative data can be gathered, opportunity opens to use mixed methods research
* Strategy: pose a general problem for the mixed methods study and gather two types of data‚Äîquantitative and qualitative‚Äîto address the problem
* Present a table that lists sources of quantitative and qualitative data in a project

---

# Core Mixed Methods Designs (1 of 2)

* Three core mixed methods designs (Figure 10.2)
  * Convergent design
  * Explanatory sequential design
  * Exploratory sequential design

---

__Figure 10.2: Three Core Designs__

![](img/Creswellrd6e_PPT102.jpg)

---

# The Convergent Mixed Methods Design(1 of 4)

* __Intent:__  to  _compare _ results from the qualitative databases with results from the quantitative databases by  _merging _ the results
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative and qualitative data provide different types of information
* Most familiar approach
* Description of the design
  * Collects both quantitative and qualitative data,
  * Analyzes them separately,
  * Compares the results to see if the findings confirm or disconfirm each other

---

* __Data collection__
  * Use the same or parallel variables, constructs, or concepts
* __Data analysis and integration__
  * Analyze qualitative database
  * Analyze quantitative database
  * Integrate the two
  * __Joint display__  ‚Äì merge forms of data in a single visual display (Table 10.2)

---

__Table 10.2: Template for a Convergent Design Joint Display__

| Scores | Theme 1 | Theme 2 | Theme 3 | Theme 4 | Metainferences |

---

* __Interpretation__
  * Discussion section compares results and notes convergence or divergence
* __Validity__
  * Quantitative validity (e.g., construct)
  * Qualitative validity (e.g., triangulation)
  * Mixed methods validity (e.g., unequal sample sizes)

---

# The Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design(1 of 4)

* __Intent:__  to  _explain _ initial quantitative _ _ results with  results from qualitative data by  _connecting _ the two databases
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative results may yield  _surprising _ information that needs  _explanation_
* Description of the design
  * Involves a two-phase project
  * Collection of quantitative data in the first phase
  * Uses results to plan the second, qualitative phase
  * Qualitative data help in explain in more detail the initial quantitative results

---

* __Data collection__
  * Two distinct phases
  * Rigorous quantitative sampling and purposeful qualitative
* __Data analysis and integration__
  * Connecting quantitative results to qualitative data collection
  * Quantitative results inform sampling and qualitative questions to ask

---

* __Key assumption__ : quantitative results may yield  _surprising _ information that needs  _explanation_
* Description of the design
  * A three-phase design
  * Start with a qualitative phase
  * Build to a feature to be tested (e.g., survey instrument)
  * Followed by a quantitative phase that tests the feature

---

* __Data collection__
  * Initial qualitative data collection
  * Test of quantitative feature
* __Integrative data analysis__
  * Analyze the two databases separately
  * Use the findings from the initial exploratory database to build into a feature

---

# The Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design  (3 of 4)

__Table 10.3: Template for an Exploratory Sequential Design Joint Display (using a survey design as an example)__

| Qualitative | Design Features | Metainferences |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |

* __Complex designs __ have core designs embedded in frameworks larger than simply collecting, analyzing, and integrating quantitative and qualitative data

---

# Types of Complex Designs

Several complex mixed methods designs:

Intersecting a secondary method (mixed methods) within a primary quantitative or qualitative design (e.g., an intervention)

Intersecting mixed methods within another methodology (e.g., evaluation)

Intersecting mixed methods within a theoretical framework (e.g., social justice)

---

# Examples of Complex Designs (1 of 5)

__Mixed methods experimental (intervention) design__  ‚Äì quantitative and qualitative data within an experiment or trial (Figure 10.3)

__Mixed methods case study design__  ‚Äì mixed methods within a single or multiple case study (Figure 10.4)

__Mixed methods participatory social justice design__  ‚Äì core mixed methods design within a larger framework (Figure 10.5)

__Mixed methods evaluation design__  ‚Äì one or more core designs in an evaluation (Figure 10.6)

# Incorporating Core Designs into Complex Designs

Identify quantitative and qualitative data collection

Draw a diagram of steps

Look in steps for opportunities to collect quantitative and qualitative data

Examine how databases are connected

Discuss overall framework or process and the embedded core designs

---

# Factors Important in Choosing a Mixed Methods Design (1 of 4)

* Choice based on intent and procedures (Table 10.5)
  * __Integration statement__
  * Example:
    * ‚ÄúIntegration involved comparing the results from the quantitative and qualitative data by merging so that a more complete understanding emerges than provided by the quantitative or the qualitative results alone.‚Äù (convergent design)
  * __Design intent __ (Figure 10.7)
  * __Select procedures that match design __ (Figure 10.8)

---

__Table 10.5: Intent and Procedures of Mixed Methods Designs__

| Mixed Methods Design | Intent or Purpose (of mixing the two databases) | Procedure (for conducting the research) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Convergent Design | Compare, Match, Corroborate (Validate), Expand, Enhance, Diffract, Identify Cases, Initiating, Complete Understanding | Merge (putting the databases side-by-side) |
| Explanatory Sequential Design | Expand, Explain | Connect (quantitative results connection with qualitative data collection) |
| Exploratory Sequential Design | Build Upon, Transfer, Generalize | Connect (qualitative results lead to design of quantitative assessment that is then tested) |
| Complex Mixed Methods Design | Augment (optimize, ascertain needs, monitor) | Add into a process/ framework&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qualitative, Quantitative, or Both Types of Data |
