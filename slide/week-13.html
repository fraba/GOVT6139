&lt;mark&gt;
*Literature review relevant across all stages of the research process. 
*Understanding and building upon what research has been done before.&lt;/mark&gt;

---

### Writing up academic research: Structure

#### Commonly used structure

* Introduction

* Literature Review

* Theory

* Data and Methods

* Results

* Conclusions

*Some variations on this ‚Äì good to look at published articles (ones using a similar approach) to see how they have structured*

**Note**: *literature review* &amp; *results* are not necessarily called that, even if that‚Äôs what it is.

---

### Writing up academic research: Structure example

#### Riding information crises: the performance of far-right Twitter users in Australia during the 2019‚Äì2020 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic 
(*open access here https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2023.2205479*)

1. Introduction

    * *Includes: Hypotheses and research questions*

2. Theoretical and conceptual framework

    * *Literature review, defining key concepts, and theoretical frameworks for information disorders and online beheaviour*
    
3. Data and methods

4. Results

5. Discussion and conclusion

---

### Writing up academic research: What goes where

**Note**: Every project will look different!

#### Introduction

* Scene setting
* Research question
* Rationale
* What I do, what I find
* Overview of the structure of the paper / thesis

#### Literature Review

* Overview of relevant previous research
* Key themes and debates
* Gap(s) that your study will address


---

### Writing up academic research: What goes where


#### Theory
* Can be part of or separate to literature review.
* Theories can come from previous literature, and your own ideas.
* Can develop the theory / theories you will test (with mechanisms), and any hypotheses.


#### Data and Methods
* Provides an overview of the research design and methods of analysis.
* Should be sufficiently detailed that another researcher could replicate what you have done.

---

### Writing up academic research: What goes where

#### Results
* This is where your analyses will be. May be one section (e.g. for a focused journal article) or multiple sections (e.g. for a PhD thesis)
* For quantitative work, this is where the graphs / tables presenting your findings will be and discussion of their contents.
* For qualitative work (e.g. interviews) this is where you would unpack and analyse the qualitative data.

#### Conclusions
* What you asked. What the paper did. Overview and discussion of findings.
* Limitations.
* Broader discussion on any implications.

---

## General tips

.pull-left[
* Look at 

    * quality research in your area;
    
    * using your method; or
    
    * from an author whose writing you like

* See how they write things up

* What goes in each section?

* What ideas do they cover from para to para?

### Publishing research

.pull-left[

#### Peer-reviewed journals
* Which journal to target? Fit / rankings / journal acceptance rate / processing time
* Submission
* Decision: Accept / Revise and Resubmit (Minor or major revisions) / Reject
* Timelines can be long / rejection is part of the process
* Mentorship from experienced researchers

#### Books
* Edited / authored
* Targeted at a wider readership

]

.pull-right[
#### Reports
* Overview of findings to reach wider audience
* See for example: Scanlon Foundation 2019 Social Cohesion Report / Australian Election Study report ‚ÄòThe 2019 Australian Federal Election: Results from the Australian Election Study‚Äô

#### Media
* The Conversation (academic rigour, journalistic flair)
* Op-eds
* Work with University media offices

## Identifying your target publication (little demo)

(Ideally, you want to have an idea **before** you start drafting)

&lt;iframe src = 'https://www.scimagojr.com/' width = 800 height = 400&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

https://www.scimagojr.com/


---

## Identifying your target publication

#### Use different entry points

1. Browse the **category/subcategory** you want to research about (e.g. "Social Sciences &gt; Sociology and Political Science") to identify a few candidates: compare them 

    * what methodology do they publish? 
    * have you referenced anything from these journals? 
    * what are their metrics: impact, acceptance rate, speed (speed is VERY important for ECR, you want that paper on your CV soon!)
    
2. Identify a number of reference **journal articles** (similar for methodology, topic, etc)

    * Where are these published,
    * Where are the articles that referenced these articles published (using Google scholar);
    * Get journals from [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)
    
3. Identify a number of **authors** (similar for methodology, topic, etc)

    * Where have they published?

---

## Publishing research

#### Who is your audience?

    * Policy-makers
    * Broader public?
    * Academic researchers?
    * All of the above?

* Academic system values peer-reviewed journal articles (unless in one of the top journals readership / citations often low)

* Writing style expected in academic journals not particularly accessible

* "Real world" values more accessible formats e.g. reports

---

#### Peer review process: Academic journals


#### Editors provide initial review


* Desk reject
     * Poor fit for the journal / not of high enough quality / not innovative enough
     * Top ranked journals do more desk rejects
     * Send to another journal!
* Or send out to peer reviewers (2-3 normal)


#### Peer review

* Double blind
* Recommend: accept / minor revisions / major revisions / reject
* Provide overall comments including areas for improvement
* Editors make a decision on the basis of reviewer feedback

---

#### Peer review process: Academic journals


#### Revise and resubmit (R&amp;R)
* Need to make any improvements identified by the reviewers and editors
* If there‚Äôs a change you can‚Äôt make, give a good justification for why
* Need to provide a document outlining how the paper has been revised in response to reviewer feedback

#### Back to editors
* May go back to original peer reviewers to review the changes
* For minor revisions, changes may be reviewed directly by the editors
* Decision (Accept / Another R&amp;R / Reject)


---

### Peer review example


| Submission | Decision |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 11-May-2022 |	08-Aug-2022: Reject &amp; Resubmit |
| 16-Sep-2022 |	14-Dec-2022: Major Revision |
| 19-Jan-2023	| 06-Mar-2023: Minor Revision |
| 17-Mar-2023	| 23-Mar-2023: Accepted |
|             | 29-Apr-2023: Published online |

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/bailo-2023.png' width = "70%"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

### Peer review process

* Process assumes good faith on part of the researchers and reviewers

* Assumes researchers aren't using fraudulent data

* Some journals require replication datasets to be published

#### Flaws

* Papers with significant (p&lt;0.05) results are more likely to get published

* Creates bias in published research as we are missing research that shows things aren‚Äôt significant

* Some journals make a point of accepting well executed research irrespective of statistical significance e.g. PLOS ONE

## The Francesca Gino Case


- **Background:** Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino, a noted ‚Äúdishonesty researcher,‚Äù was suspended after allegations of data manipulation in four papers she co-authored.
- **Lawsuit:** Gino sued Harvard and the bloggers who first published the allegations, claiming defamation.
- **Harvard's Investigation:**
  - An independent investigation found evidence of data manipulation in Gino's papers from 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2020.
  - The investigation report, recently unsealed, found Gino's defense‚Äîthat a rival manipulated her data‚Äîimplausible.
- **Impact on Scientific Community:**
  - Gino's lawsuit may deter others from exposing fraud due to the high cost and long duration of defamation cases.
  - Highlights the need for better processes to identify and address scientific fraud.

## Big Data

&gt; data that is so large, fast or complex that it‚Äôs difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods.

Three **V**‚Äôs

* **V**olume: Organizations collect data from a variety of sources‚Ä¶ in the past, storing it would have been a problem ‚Äì but cheaper storage on (various) platforms... have eased the burden.

* **V**elocity: With the growth in the Internet of Things, data streams in to businesses at an unprecedented speed and must be handled in a timely manner.

* **V**ariety: Data comes in all types of formats ‚Äì from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, emails, videos, audios, stock ticker data and financial transactions.

# Predictions

---

## Big Data: Election polling

* Nate Silver's **FiveThirtyEight**

* Combines data from range of polls rather than relying on a single poll

* US context: 2012 &amp; 2020 "success", 2016 "failure".

* Problem: Relies on the quality of individual polls ("garbage in, garbage out" problem); assumes no *systematic* error.

#### Problem with polling (garbage in, garbage out)

Pollsters all incorporate priors while crunching their numbers. That is, this can create a "herd"  effect as they all systematically over/under estimate some value (e.g. voting).  

For example, even in 2020 I noticed that polls still (even the big miss in 2016) systematically udnerestimates Trump's votes.

# Online mass experiments

## Online mass experiments: Example 1

Salganik, M. J., Dodds, P. S., &amp; Watts, D. J. (2006). Experimental study of inequality and unpredictability in an artificial cultural market. *Science*, 311(5762), 854‚Äì856. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1121066

&gt; Hit songs, books, and movies are many times more successful than average, suggesting that ‚Äúthe best‚Äù alternatives are qualitatively different from ‚Äúthe rest‚Äù; yet experts routinely fail to predict which products will succeed. We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial ‚Äúmusic market‚Äù in which **14,341 participants** downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants' choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.

---

## Online mass experiments: Example 2

Centola, D. (2010). The spread of behavior in an online social network experiment. *Science*, 329(5996), 1194‚Äì1197. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1185231

&gt; How do social networks affect the spread of behavior? A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. **The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks** than across corresponding random networks.

&gt; Randomization of participants to clustered-lattice and random-network conditions in a single trial of this study (N = 128, Z = 6). In each condition, the black node shows the focal node of a neighborhood to which an individual is being assigned, and the red nodes correspond to that individual‚Äôs neighbors in the network. In the clustered-lattice network, the red nodes share neighbors with each other, whereas in the random network they do not. White nodes indicate individuals who are not connected to the focal node.

# Replication

---

## Replication

### Replication crisis
* Finding that many studies unable to be reproduced
* Psychology in particular (also medical science)

### Increasing standard for researchers to:
* Present their research in a way that another researcher would be able to replicate their analyses
* Many journals expect scholars to publish replication datasets and supplementary materials

### Learning how to do research?
* Start by trying to replicate a published paper
* Gary King Harvard quant methods class

## Survey data example

"[Almost one-third of adult Australians say they‚Äôre unlikely to get COVID vaccination: survey](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/almost-one-third-of-adult-australians-say-they-re-unlikely-to-get-covid-vaccination-survey-20210518-p57szo.html)"

.pull-right[
### Flaws in SMH reporting
1.	Dropping Australians who have already been vaccinated from totals
    * Incorporating vaccinated in totals reduces those unlikely to get vaccine from 29% to 22%
    * Headline incorrect
2.	Survey question wording
    * Unbalanced response categories (3 likely / 2 not likely; see Monroe Ch. 5)

### Key takeaways from this course (II)

.small[

#### Some questions to ask when you are reading research articles (or reports/books)

* How did the researchers go about it?
* What cases did they select?
* What was the timing of the study?
* Did they use quantitative / qualitative methods? What kind?
* Are the researchers making causal claims? If so does the evidence support their conclusions?
* Are measures valid? Do they capture the concepts they purport to measure?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses in terms of internal / external validity?
* If survey research (/polling): How did the researchers go about it? What sampling approach was used (probability/non-probability)? Are the results representative of a population? If so what population? Are survey questions a good fit to measure concepts of interest?
* If qualitative research e.g. interviewing: How did the researchers go about it? Who did they interview? In what context? Are findings context specific?
* If there are multiple studies on a similar topic ‚Äì are the findings pointing in the same direction or is there debate?

## Going about research

* This course a very broad introduction / ‚Äòtaster‚Äô

  * Now you might want to consider: 
  
    * SSPS6004: Social Research Ethics
    * SSPS6006: Data Analytics for Social Research

* To go about research takes time and training

* Is there one right way to go about research?

* Can qual and quant methods be combined?

* Social science research can be a lot of fun (talking to people about their experiences, travel, analyzing data, creating data visualizations ‚Äì bringing evidence to questions people have about the world)

# Workshopping Your Research Proposal


---

## Workshopping Your Research proposal

1. Write down your **research question** in a single sentence (if you have more than a question, focus on the first/main question)

2. Describe your research design in three sentences: Explain, 
  * **theory**, what do you think is going on?
  * **data**, what data will you collect?
  * **methods/analysis**, how do you plan to analyse the data?
  
3. Prepare to present these four sentences in 5 minutes.
