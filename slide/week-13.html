# Introduction

## Mixed methods procedure

* Combining qualitative and quantitative forms for more understanding

* Limitations and strengths of each type of data collection

* Nature of mixed methods

* Reasons to use

---

# Characteristics of Mixed Methods Research

## The mixed methods researcher:

1. Collects two types of data— _qualitative (open-ended)_  _ and _  _quantitative (closed- ended) _ data—to study the research problem or question

2. Connects the two data sets, called  _integration_

3. Uses procedures to integrate the two data sets, called a  _mixed methods design_

4. Analyses integration typically in a table, called a  _joint display_ , by representing the two databases together in the procedures

5. Draws conclusions, insight, or interpretation from the integration analysis, called  _metainferences_

6. Frames the study with the researcher’s beliefs, values (**worldview**), and explanations drawn from the literature (**theories**)

---

# Justification for Using Mixed Methods Research

## Reasons for choosing mixed methods

* Developing a **complete understanding** of a research problem by combining **quantitative** and **qualitative** results

* Explaining quantitative results in detail with qualitative descriptions

* Improving measures, scales, and instruments

But also, 

* Augmenting experiments

* Developing cases

* Evaluating programs

* Understanding changes needed for marginalized group

---

# Definitions of Mixed Methods Terms

### Open-ended data

* Information gathered where researchers ask a question but do not provide a response option
  
  * E.g., Participants share views, researcher records them
    
* Information gathered when researchers provide a qualitative description of a document (sociql media post)
    
### Closed-ended data

* Information gathered where the researcher provides participants with response options
  
  * E.g., Rating scales (likert)
    
* Information generated classifying a document's topic (like a media post) using software 

---

# Research Design

## Procedure used in conducting a study

Two categories:  **core designs** and  **complex designs**

### Core Designs

Designs found in all mixed methods studies including convergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs

### Complex Designs

Primary intent not simply integration of two databases but to have mixed methods  _support _ the procedures of a process or framework


---

# More key terminology for mixed-methods research

### Integration

* Central concept in mixed methods research

* Involves combining in a study or a series of studies information from qualitative and quantitative data

### Joint Display

* Table or graph that presents side-by-side combination of two combined databases
  
### Metainferences

* Insights that emerge as researcher compares the quantitative and qualitative databases

---

# The Process of Conducting a Mixed Methods Study

## Connecting the quantitative and qualitative data to a specific type of mixed methods design

1. Researcher draws a diagram of the design

2. Integrates the two databases

3. Presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis

4. Draws insights or **metainferences** from results of the integration

# Core Mixed Methods Designs

---

# Core Mixed Methods Designs

## Three core mixed methods designs

1. **Convergent** design (One-phase design)

2. **Explanatory** sequential design (Two-phase design)

3. **Exploratory** sequential design  (Three-phase design)

---

__Figure 10.2: Three Core Designs__

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/Creswellrd6e_PPT102.jpg' width = '80%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

# The Convergent Mixed Methods Design

* __Intent:__  to  _compare _ results from the qualitative databases with results from the quantitative databases by  _merging _ the results
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative and qualitative data provide different types of information
* Most familiar approach
* Description of the design
  * Collects both quantitative and qualitative data,
  * Analyzes them separately,
  * Compares the results to see if the findings confirm or disconfirm each other

---

# The Convergent Mixed Methods Design

### Data collection

* Use the same or parallel variables, constructs, or concepts

### Data analysis and integration

* Analyse qualitative database
* Analyse quantitative database
* Integrate the two
* __Joint display__  – merge forms of data in a single visual display (Table 10.2)

---

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/Creswellrd6e_PPT102.jpg' width = '80%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

# The Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

* __Intent:__  to  _explain _ initial quantitative _ _ results with  results from qualitative data by  _connecting _ the two databases
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative results may yield  _surprising _ information that needs  _explanation_
* Description of the design
  * Involves a two-phase project
  * Collection of quantitative data in the first phase
  * Uses results to plan the second, qualitative phase
  * Qualitative data help in explain in more detail the initial quantitative results

---

# The Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

### Data collection

* Two distinct phases

* Rigorous quantitative sampling and purposeful qualitative

### Data analysis and integration

* Connecting quantitative results to qualitative data collection
  
* Quantitative results inform sampling and qualitative questions to ask

# The Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

* __Intent:__  to  _explore _ how qualitative data can improve quantitative measures, scales, or instruments
* __Key assumption__ : quantitative results may yield  _surprising _ information that needs  _explanation_
* Description of the design
  * A three-phase design
  * Start with a qualitative phase
  * Build to a feature to be tested (e.g., survey instrument)
  * Followed by a quantitative phase that tests the feature

---

# The Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design

### Data collection

* Initial qualitative data collection

* Test of quantitative feature

### Integrative data analysis

* Analyse the two databases separately

* Use the findings from the initial exploratory database to build into a feature

* Qualitative findings inform design of quantitative phase (e.g., instrument, variables)

# Complex Mixed Methods Designs

---

# Complex Mixed Methods Designs

* All mixed methods studies have at least one  **core design** (e.g., convergent, explanatory sequential, or exploratory sequential)

* **Complex designs** have core designs embedded in frameworks larger than simply collecting, analysing, and integrating quantitative and qualitative data

---

# Types of Complex Designs

Several complex mixed methods designs:


* Intersecting a secondary method (mixed methods) within a primary quantitative or qualitative design (e.g., an intervention)

* Intersecting mixed methods within another methodology (e.g., evaluation)

* Intersecting mixed methods within a theoretical framework (e.g., social justice)

---

# Examples of Complex Designs

__Mixed methods experimental (intervention) design__  – quantitative and qualitative data within an experiment or trial (Figure 10.3)

__Mixed methods case study design__  – mixed methods within a single or multiple case study (Figure 10.4)

__Mixed methods participatory social justice design__  – core mixed methods design within a larger framework (Figure 10.5)

__Mixed methods evaluation design__  – one or more core designs in an evaluation (Figure 10.6)

# Incorporating Core Designs into Complex Designs

* Identify quantitative and qualitative data collection

* Draw a diagram of steps

* Look in steps for opportunities to collect quantitative and qualitative data

* Examine how databases are connected

* Discuss overall framework or process and the embedded core designs

---

## Factors Important in Choosing a Mixed Methods Design

### Choice based on intent and procedures

1. **Integration statement**

&gt; Integration involved comparing the results from the quantitative and qualitative data by merging so that a more complete understanding emerges than provided by the quantitative or the qualitative results alone.” (convergent design example)

2\. **Design intent**
  
3\. **Select procedures that match design**

---

__Table 10.5: Intent and Procedures of Mixed Methods Designs__

| Mixed Methods Design | Intent or Purpose (of mixing the two databases) | Procedure (for conducting the research) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Convergent Design | Compare, Match, Corroborate (Validate), Expand, Enhance, Diffract, Identify Cases, Initiating, Complete Understanding | Merge (putting the databases side-by-side) |
| Explanatory Sequential Design | Expand, Explain | Connect (quantitative results connection with qualitative data collection) |
| Exploratory Sequential Design | Build Upon, Transfer, Generalize | Connect (qualitative results lead to design of quantitative assessment that is then tested) |
| Complex Mixed Methods Design | Augment (optimize, ascertain needs, monitor) | Add into a process/ framework&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qualitative, Quantitative, or Both Types of Data |

### Choice based on

* Popular designs in a field or discipline

* Single researcher or team

* Choice by advisors or mentors

* Timing in mixed methods data collection – convergent or sequential

* Emphasis placed on each database – equal or unequal

---

### Writing up academic research: Structure

#### Commonly used structure

* Introduction

* Literature Review

* Theory

* Data and Methods

* Results

* Conclusions

*Some variations on this – good to look at published articles (ones using a similar approach) to see how they have structured*

**Note**: *literature review* &amp; *results* are not necessarily called that, even if that’s what it is.

---

### Writing up academic research: Structure example

#### Riding information crises: the performance of far-right Twitter users in Australia during the 2019–2020 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic 
(*open access here https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2023.2205479*)

1. Introduction

    * *Includes: Hypotheses and research questions*

2. Theoretical and conceptual framework

    * *Literature review, defining key concepts, and theoretical frameworks for information disorders and online beheaviour*
    
3. Data and methods

4. Results

5. Discussion and conclusion

---

### Writing up academic research: What goes where

**Note**: Every project will look different!

#### Introduction

* Scene setting
* Research question
* Rationale
* What I do, what I find
* Overview of the structure of the paper / thesis

#### Literature Review

* Overview of relevant previous research
* Key themes and debates
* Gap(s) that your study will address


---

### Writing up academic research: What goes where


#### Theory
* Can be part of or separate to literature review.
* Theories can come from previous literature, and your own ideas.
* Can develop the theory / theories you will test (with mechanisms), and any hypotheses.


#### Data and Methods
* Provides an overview of the research design and methods of analysis.
* Should be sufficiently detailed that another researcher could replicate what you have done.

---

### Writing up academic research: What goes where

#### Results
* This is where your analyses will be. May be one section (e.g. for a focused journal article) or multiple sections (e.g. for a PhD thesis)
* For quantitative work, this is where the graphs / tables presenting your findings will be and discussion of their contents.
* For qualitative work (e.g. interviews) this is where you would unpack and analyse the qualitative data.

#### Conclusions
* What you asked. What the paper did. Overview and discussion of findings.
* Limitations.
* Broader discussion on any implications.

---

## General tips

.pull-left[
* Look at 

    * quality research in your area;
    
    * using your method; or
    
    * from an author whose writing you like

* See how they write things up

* What goes in each section?

* What ideas do they cover from para to para?

### Publishing research

.pull-left[

#### Peer-reviewed journals
* Which journal to target? Fit / rankings / journal acceptance rate / processing time
* Submission
* Decision: Accept / Revise and Resubmit (Minor or major revisions) / Reject
* Timelines can be long / rejection is part of the process
* Mentorship from experienced researchers

#### Books
* Edited / authored
* Targeted at a wider readership

]

.pull-right[
#### Reports
* Overview of findings to reach wider audience
* See for example: Scanlon Foundation 2019 Social Cohesion Report / Australian Election Study report ‘The 2019 Australian Federal Election: Results from the Australian Election Study’

#### Media
* The Conversation (academic rigour, journalistic flair)
* Op-eds
* Work with University media offices
]

---

## Identifying your target publication

#### Use different entry points

1. Browse the **category/subcategory** you want to research about (e.g. "Social Sciences &gt; Sociology and Political Science") to identify a few candidates: compare them 

    * what methodology do they publish? 
    * have you referenced anything from these journals? 
    * what are their metrics: impact, acceptance rate, speed (speed is VERY important for ECR, you want that paper on your CV soon!)
    
2. Identify a number of reference **journal articles** (similar for methodology, topic, etc)

    * Where are these published,
    * Where are the articles that referenced these articles published (using Google scholar);
    * Get journals from [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)
    
3. Identify a number of **authors** (similar for methodology, topic, etc)

    * Where have they published?

---

## Publishing research

#### Who is your audience?

    * Policy-makers
    * Broader public?
    * Academic researchers?
    * All of the above?

* Academic system values peer-reviewed journal articles (unless in one of the top journals readership / citations often low)

* Writing style expected in academic journals not particularly accessible

* "Real world" values more accessible formats e.g. reports

---

#### Peer review process: Academic journals


#### Editors provide initial review


* Desk reject
     * Poor fit for the journal / not of high enough quality / not innovative enough
     * Top ranked journals do more desk rejects
     * Send to another journal!
* Or send out to peer reviewers (2-3 normal)


#### Peer review

* Double blind
* Recommend: accept / minor revisions / major revisions / reject
* Provide overall comments including areas for improvement
* Editors make a decision on the basis of reviewer feedback

---

#### Peer review process: Academic journals


#### Revise and resubmit (R&amp;R)
* Need to make any improvements identified by the reviewers and editors
* If there’s a change you can’t make, give a good justification for why
* Need to provide a document outlining how the paper has been revised in response to reviewer feedback

#### Back to editors
* May go back to original peer reviewers to review the changes
* For minor revisions, changes may be reviewed directly by the editors
* Decision (Accept / Another R&amp;R / Reject)


---

### Peer review example


| Submission | Decision |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 11-May-2022 |	08-Aug-2022: Reject &amp; Resubmit |
| 16-Sep-2022 |	14-Dec-2022: Major Revision |
| 19-Jan-2023	| 06-Mar-2023: Minor Revision |
| 17-Mar-2023	| 23-Mar-2023: Accepted |
|             | 29-Apr-2023: Published online |

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/bailo-2023.png' width = "70%"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

### Peer review process

* Process assumes good faith on part of the researchers and reviewers

* Assumes researchers aren't using fraudulent data

* Some journals require replication datasets to be published

#### Flaws

* Papers with significant (p&lt;0.05) results are more likely to get published

* Creates bias in published research as we are missing research that shows things aren’t significant

* Some journals make a point of accepting well executed research irrespective of statistical significance e.g. PLOS ONE

# Replication

---

## Replication

### Replication crisis (of quantitative research)
* Finding that many studies unable to be reproduced
* Psychology in particular (also medical science)

### Increasing standard for researchers to (for both quant and qual researchers):
* Present their research in a way that another researcher would be able to replicate their analyses
* Many journals expect scholars to publish replication datasets and supplementary materials
* Pre-registration of studies

### Learning how to do research?
* Start by trying to replicate a published paper

* Did they use quantitative / qualitative methods? What kind?
* Are the researchers making causal claims? If so does the evidence support their conclusions?
* Are measures valid? Do they capture the concepts they purport to measure?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses in terms of internal / external validity?
* If survey research (/polling): How did the researchers go about it? What sampling approach was used (probability/non-probability)? Are the results representative of a population? If so what population? Are survey questions a good fit to measure concepts of interest?
* If qualitative research e.g. interviewing: How did the researchers go about it? Who did they interview? In what context? Are findings context specific?
* If there are multiple studies on a similar topic – are the findings pointing in the same direction or is there debate?

## Going about research

* This course a very broad introduction / ‘taster’

  * Now you might want to consider: 
  
    * SSPS6004: Social Research Ethics
    * SSPS6006: Data Analytics for Social Research

* To go about research takes time and training

* Is there one right way to go about research?

* Can qual and quant methods be combined?

* Social science research can be a lot of fun (talking to people about their experiences, travel, analyzing data, creating data visualizations – bringing evidence to questions people have about the world)
