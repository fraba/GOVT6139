    * Measurements

* Group exercise

* Primary and secondary data

---

## Recap: Epistemological positions

.center[&lt;img src = "../img/marsh-onto-epi.png" width = "100%"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

(Marsh et al., 2018, p. 179)

Note: Generally, post-positivism = *Critical* realism. Objectivity but with biases. 

---

## Individual task

Let's quickly answer last week's questions:

## Recap: Epistemological positions

.pull-left[
**Positivism**

*Objectivist ontology: Real world out there, independent of our observation*

* Can therefore establish â€˜realâ€™ relationships between social phenomena
* Can study these relationships via direct observation
* Interested in causal relationships
* Researcher objectivity

]

.pull-right[

**Interpretivism**

*Constructivist ontology: The world is socially constructed*

* Social phenomena cannot be understood independently of our interpretation of them
* More subjective: No observer can be objective because he/she lives in the world and participates in the social construction of reality
* Double hermeneutic â€“ the world is interpreted by the actors and their interpretation is interpreted by the observers

## Key research question

### What does explain declining satisfaction with democracy in Australia?

---

## Context 1/2 

### Declining satisfaction with democracy in Australia

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/cameron-01.png' width = '75%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## Context 2/2 

### Satisfaction with democracy in Anglo-American democracies

## What explains declining satisfaction with democracy in Australia?

Media commentary on the decline:

.pull-left[

* Democratic malaise affecting other advanced democracies

* Frequent changes of Prime Minister

&gt; "There have been some rather unkind comments about Australia being the *Italy of the South Pacific* and the *coup capital of the world*" (Julie Bishop 2018)

]

.pull-right[
.center[&lt;img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Portrait_of_Julie_Bishop.jpg' width = 70%&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]
]

Cameron's paper provides an empirical test of explanations.

---

## What explains satisfaction with democracy? 
## Theory

Key findings of previous comparative studies:
1.	**Political institutions**
    * Electoral system: Majoritarian vs. proportional representation
    * Electoral winners / losers
2.	**Culture and values**
    * Rising levels of education affect citizen attitudes
    * Generational change, younger generations more critical
3.	**Government performance**
    * Economic performance
    * Political performance
    
See: Anderson and Guillory (1997); Huang et al. (2008); Inglehart (1997); Norris (1999).

---

## Explaining dissatisfaction with democracy in Australia
## Theory II

* **Political performance**
    * Leadership changes: 6 Prime Minsters in a span of 8 years
    
    * Changes driven by party infighting not voters
    
    * Only one change of PM resulting from an election (2013) [Remember paper was published in 2020]
    
* **Economic performance**

    * Voter pessimism about the state of the economy
    
    * In 2016 just 10% thought economy had improved in past year

---

## Explaining dissatisfaction with democracy in Australia

### Hypotheses

1. Those disapproving of the leadership changes more dissatisfied with democracy

2. Those pessimistic about the economy more dissatisfied with democracy

Note the IF ... THEN .... This is an important approach for multivariate analysis and positivist research

---

## Data and Methods I: The Australian Election Study

.pull-left[

* National, post-election surveys asking â‰ˆ 250 questions about politics and the election.

* 1987-2022. Satisfaction with democracy measured since 1996.

* Surveys representative of the Australian population.

* Data available from: www.australianelectionstudy.org

## Data and Methods II: Key measures

**Dependent variable: Satisfaction with democracy** (1996-2019)

&gt; On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with the way democracy works in Australia? [Very satisfied / Fairly satisfied / Not very satisfied / Not at all satisfied]

**Independent variable: Approval of leadership changes** (2010, 2019)
&gt; Do you approve or disapprove of the way the [Liberal Party] handled the leadership change in [September of last year] when [Malcolm Turnbull] replaced [Tony Abbott]? [Strongly approve / Approve / Disapprove / Strongly disapprove]

** Independent variable: Economic evaluations** (1987-2019)
&gt; And how do you think the general economic situation in Australia now compares with what it was 12 months ago? [A lot better / A little better / About the same / A little worse / A lot worse]

---

## Dependent and independent variables (snapshot recap)

The dependent variable, usually indicated with `\(Y\)`, is the variable on which the independent variable(s), usually `\(X\)`, has an effect.

Synonyms from Wikipedia

| independent | dependent |
| -- | -- | 
| input | output |
| regressor |	regressand |
| predictor |	predicted |
| explanatory |	explained |
| exogenous |	endogenous |
| manipulated |	measured |
| exposure |	outcome |

---

## Data and Methods III: Approach


### Quantitative methods

* Examine trends over time

* Examine relationships between variables

* Regression modelling to:

    * Examine effects of government performance (political and economic) on satisfaction with democracy
    
    * Whilst controlling for other factors expected to affect satisfaction with democracy â€“ electoral winners/losers, education level, age etc.

* Donâ€™t worry about the details here â€“ we will unpack all this in Weeks 8-11 on quantitative methods

---

## Approval of leadership changes, 2010â€“2018

&gt; Do you approve or disapprove of the way the [Labor party] handled the leadership change [in June of this year], when [Julia Gillard] replaced [Kevin Rudd]?

## Approval of leadership changes and satisfaction with democracy

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/cameron-05.png' width = '75%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

Note: The Y-axis (vertical) is changed now. This charts directly investigates (now for the first time) the relationship between two variables.

---

## Economic perceptions and satisfaction with democracy

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/cameron-06.png' width = '72%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

Source: Australian Election Study and OECD (GDP growth).

Note: Survey variables from a number of years are compared to GDP measures.

## Explaining satisfaction with democracy

A regression table ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜± (Note: Four-point measure of satisfaction with democracy is the dependent variable)

.center[&lt;img src = '../img/cameron-07.png' width = '79%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## Conclusions

**The effect of government performance**

* Frequent leadership changes and negative economic perceptions
undermined satisfaction with democracy.

**Contribution**
* Sheds light on an interesting case.

* Examines the effects of frequent prime ministerial turnover on citizen attitudes towards democracy.

* Results suggest satisfaction with democracy in Australia reflects homegrown factors, not just global trends.

---

## What makes this research positivist?

*Assumptions*
* Social phenomena can be directly observed and measured
    * E.g. satisfaction with democracy measured via survey
    * These measurements enable comparisons â€“ between individuals, and even across countries
    * Can examine relationships between social phenomena â€“ e.g. attitudes towards the leadership changes and satisfaction with democracy
    
* Assumed objectivity of the researcher

* Interested in causal explanations
    * i.e. what caused satisfaction with democracy to decline in Australia?
    
* Interested to discover general, universal laws
    * Frequent changes of political leaders (outside of elections) undermine satisfaction with democracy
    * Testing and building upon established theories

---

## Individual task

### Think about a key difference between interpretivism and positivism in practice using as an example the research by Peter Chen and Sarah Cameron (e.g. think about research questions or methods and data).

# Introduction to research design

.center[&lt;img src = 'https://i.gifer.com/77Rw.gif'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## What is research design?

### Broad definition

Research design can refer to a whole proposal for a research project, including the 

* review of the literature, 
* research questions, 
* hypotheses, 
* selection of cases,
* details of data collection and 
* methods of data analysis.

### Narrow definition

Research design refers to "the logical method by which we propose to test a hypothesis".

Monroe 2018, *Essentials of Political Research*, p. 31, Chapter 3 Research Design https://www-taylorfrancis-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/books/9780429500749
