## Writing up academic research: Structure

### Commonly used structure

* Introduction

* Literature Review

* Theory

* Data and Methods

* Results

* Conclusions

*Some variations on this ‚Äì good to look at published articles (ones using a similar approach) to see how they have structured*

**Note**: *literature review* & *results* are not necessarily called that, even if that‚Äôs what it is.

## Writing up academic research: Structure example

### Riding information crises: the performance of far-right Twitter users in Australia during the 2019‚Äì2020 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic 
(*open access here https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2023.2205479*)

1. Introduction

    * *Includes: Hypotheses and research questions*

2. Theoretical and conceptual framework

    * *Literature review, defining key concepts, and theoretical frameworks for information disorders and online beheaviour*
    
3. Data and methods

4. Results

5. Discussion and conclusion

### Writing up academic research: What goes where

**Note**: Every project will look different!

#### Introduction
* Scene setting
* Research question
* Rationale
* What I do, what I find
* Overview of the structure of the paper / thesis

#### Literature Review
* Overview of relevant previous research
* Key themes and debates
* Gap(s) that your study will address

#### Theory
* Can be part of or separate to literature review.
* Theories can come from previous literature, and your own ideas.
* Can develop the theory / theories you will test (with mechanisms), and any hypotheses.

### Writing up academic research: What goes where

#### Data and Methods
* Provides an overview of the research design and methods of analysis.
* Should be sufficiently detailed that another researcher could replicate what you have done.

#### Results
* This is where your analyses will be. May be one section (e.g. for a focused journal article) or multiple sections (e.g. for a PhD thesis)
* For quantitative work, this is where the graphs / tables presenting your findings will be and discussion of their contents.
* For qualitative work (e.g. interviews) this is where you would unpack and analyse the qualitative data.

#### Conclusions
* What you asked. What the paper did. Overview and discussion of findings.
* Limitations.
* Broader discussion on any implications.
