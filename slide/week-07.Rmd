## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. **Describe** the relationship among the problem, the purpose statement, and the research questions
2. **Identify** the three major components of a qualitative purpose statement
3. **Identify** the central phenomenon in a qualitative purpose statement
4. **State** a quantitative purpose statement with variables and their relationships
5. **Describe** the four essential components of a mixed methods purpose statement

---

## What is a Purpose Statement?

A purpose statement:
- **Indicates** why you want to do the study and what you intend to accomplish
- **Conveys** the overall intent of a proposed study in one sentence or several sentences
- **Sets forth** the intent of the study
- Represents the **most important statement** in the study
- Needs to be **clear, specific, and informative**

### Distinguished from:
- The **problem** (the need for the research)
- The **research questions**

---

## The Research Hierarchy

```
The Problem
    ↓
The Purpose/Aim
    ↓
The Research Questions
    ↓
The Data
```

### Example Flow:
- **Problem**: People are refusing to get vaccinated for COVID
- **Purpose**: Identify the factors influencing vaccination refusal
- **Research Question**: Are participants refusing vaccination because they suspect long-term health consequences?
- **Data**: Mailed questionnaire to collect data

---

## Purpose Statement Design Guidelines

### General Principles:
- Set apart as a **separate sentence or paragraph**
- Use research language: "The purpose of this study is (was) (will be)..."
- **Present/past tense** for completed studies
- **Future tense** for proposals
- Make it the **central organising idea** of the study

---

# Task 1: Identify Four Research Components in Abstracts

## Identify and locate these four components in each abstract:

1. **Problem** - What issue or gap does the study address?
2. **Purpose** - What is the study's main objective or intent?
3. **Research Question** - What specific question(s) does the study investigate?
4. **Data** - What type of data/evidence was collected?

# Qualitative Purpose Statements

---

## Qualitative Purpose Statement Components

A good qualitative purpose statement contains:

1. **Central phenomenon** explored in the study
2. **Participants** in the study  
3. **Research site**
4. **Qualitative approach** used
5. **Action verbs** indicating how learning will take place
6. **Neutral, nondirectional language**

---

## What is a Phenomenon?

### Definition in Qualitative Research

A **phenomenon** is the **single central concept** or **key idea** being explored in a qualitative study.

### Key Characteristics
- **One focused concept** - not multiple ideas or relationships between variables
- **Exploratory in nature** - something to be understood, discovered, or examined
- **Experiential or social** - often involves human experiences, behaviors, or social processes
- **Context-dependent** - understood within specific settings and circumstances

---

### Examples of Phenomena (plural of phenomenon)
- **Teacher burnout experiences** in urban schools
- **Identity formation** among first-in-the-family college students  
- **Grief processes** following sudden loss
- **Decision-making patterns** in family businesses
- **Cultural adaptation** of immigrant communities
- **Leadership emergence** in crisis situations

---

### What Phenomena Are NOT
- ❌ **Relationships between variables** (that's quantitative)
- ❌ **Multiple separate concepts** (focus on one)
- ❌ **Predetermined outcomes** (avoid directional language)
- ❌ **Measurable constructs** (focus on understanding, not measurement)

**Remember**: The phenomenon is **what you want to understand**, not what you want to prove or measure.

---

## Design Features for Qualitative Purpose Statements

### 1. Signal Words
- Use words like **purpose, intent, objective**
- "The purpose of this study is..."

### 2. Single Focus
- Focus on **one central phenomenon**
- Narrow to one idea to be explored
- Avoid relating or comparing variables

### 3. Action Verbs
- **understand, develop, explore, examine, generate, discover**
- Keep inquiry open and exploratory

---

## Design Features (Continued)

### 4. Neutral Language
- Use **nondirectional** words and phrases
- ✅ "exploring the self-expression experiences"
- ❌ "successful self-expression experiences"
- Avoid: useful, positive, informing

### 5. Working Definition
- Provide **general definition** of central phenomenon
- "A tentative definition at this time for _____ is..."
- Acknowledge it may evolve during study

---

## Design Features (Final)

### 6. Qualitative Approach
- Specify the approach: **ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative**

### 7. Participants
- Mention **individuals, groups, organizations**

### 8. Research Site
- Identify **homes, classrooms, organizations, programs, events**
- Provide enough detail for clarity

### 9. Delimitations
- Scope limitations (e.g., "only women", "one geographic area")

---

## Qualitative Purpose Statement Script

```
The purpose of this _____ (qualitative approach) study 
is (was/will be) to _____ (action verb: understand? 
explore? develop?) the _____ (central phenomenon) 
for _____ (participants) at _____ (research site). 

At this stage in the research, the _____ (central 
phenomenon) will be generally defined as _____ 
(provide a general definition).
```

---

## Qualitative Example: Phenomenology Study

**Lauterbach (1993)** - mothers who lost babies in late pregnancy:

> "The phenomenological inquiry, as part of uncovering meaning, articulated 'essences' of meaning in mothers' lived experiences when their wished-for babies died. Using the lens of the feminist perspective, the focus was on mothers' memories and their 'living through' experience..."

**Analysis:**
- **Central phenomenon**: Mothers' lived experiences
- **Action word**: Articulated, uncovering
- **Approach**: Phenomenological inquiry
- **Participants**: Mothers
- **Site**: Homes

---

## Qualitative Example: Case Study

**Frelin (2015)** - teacher relationships with students:

> "The purpose of this article is to trace and exemplify relational and professional practices that can help teachers and other school staff to assist students to overcome obstacles and be more successful at school."

**Analysis:**
- **Central phenomenon**: Relational and professional practices  
- **Action verbs**: Trace, exemplify
- **Approach**: Case study (one teacher, Gunilla)
- **Participants**: One teacher
- **Site**: Municipal school

## Quantitative Purpose Statement Components

Quantitative purpose statements focus on **relating or comparing** variables and include:

1. **Variables** and their relationships
2. **Participants** and research site
3. **Language** associated with quantitative research
4. **Theory** being tested
5. **Deductive** approach

### Key Difference:
Focus on **variables** rather than phenomena

---

## Major Components of Quantitative Purpose Statements

### 1. Signal Words
- "The purpose of this study is..."

### 2. Research Approach

### 3. Theory/Framework
- Identify **theory, model, or conceptual framework**

### 4. Variables
- **Independent, dependent, mediating, moderating** variables

---

## Major Components (Continued)

### 5. Connecting Words
- **"relationship", "comparison", "determinants", "correlation", "prediction"**
- Or simply "describe" variables

### 6. Variable Order
- **Left to right**: Independent → Mediating → Dependent
- Independent variable **always first**

### 7. Participants & Site
- Mention **unit of analysis** and research location

### 8. Variable Definitions
- **Define key variables** using accepted definitions

---

## Quantitative Purpose Statement Script

```
The purpose of this _____ (experiment/survey) study 
is to test the theory of _____ that _____ (explains/
predicts) that the _____ (independent variable) 
_____ (compares/relates) to _____ (dependent 
variable). 

This study aims to recruit _____ (participants) at 
_____ (research site). The independent variable 
will be defined as _____. The dependent variable 
will be defined as _____.
```

---

## Quantitative Example: Survey Study

**DeGraw (1984)** - educators in correctional institutions:

**Analysis:**
- **Relationship** word used
- **Independent variable**: Personal characteristics  
- **Dependent variable**: Job motivation
- **Participants**: Certified educators
- **Site**: State correctional institutions
- Variables **defined** in the statement

---

## Quantitative Example: Experimental Study

**Esposito et al. (2017)** - online shopping nudges:

> "This study was based on this assumption and sought to test how small changes to a website's design can affect purchase behaviour, with particular attention to the interaction with socio-demographic characteristics of the participant."

**Analysis:**
- **Independent variables**: Website design changes, demographics
- **Dependent variable**: Purchase behavior
- **Participants**: 626 participants
- **Design**: 3 × 2 × 2 experimental design

## Mixed Methods Purpose Statement Components

A mixed methods purpose statement includes:

1. **Overall intent** of the study
2. **Type** of mixed methods design
3. **Both quantitative and qualitative** language
4. **Integration** of both strands
5. **Insight** expected from combining databases

---

## Guidelines for Mixed Methods Purpose Statements

.pull-left[

### 1. Signal Intent
- "The purpose of" or "The intent of"

### 2. Overall Content Intent
- What you want to accomplish by study's end
- Should have **practical value**

]

.pull-right[

### 3. Design Type
- **Convergent, explanatory sequential, exploratory sequential, complex**

### 4. Mixed Language
- **Quantitative words**: testing, relating, comparing
- **Qualitative words**: exploring, understanding, generating

]

---

## Types of Insight from Integration

### Convergent Design
- **More complete understanding** by comparing quantitative and qualitative results

### Explanatory Sequential Design  
- **Explain quantitative results** with qualitative follow-up for deeper understanding

### Exploratory Sequential Design
- **Develop/improve quantitative measures** by first gathering qualitative data

### Complex Design
- **Enrich frameworks** by adding qualitative, quantitative data, or both

---

## Mixed Methods Script: Convergent Design

```
This mixed methods study will address _____ (overall 
intent). A convergent mixed methods design will be used. 
In this study, _____ (quantitative data) will be used to 
test the theory of _____ that predicts _____ (independent 
variables) will _____ influence _____ (dependent variables) 
for _____ (participants) at _____ (site). 

The _____ (qualitative data type) will explore _____ 
(central phenomenon) for _____ (participants) at _____ 
(site). The insight from combining databases will _____ 
(provide more complete understanding/validate results).
```

---

## Mixed Methods Script: Explanatory Sequential

```
This study will address _____ (overall intent). An 
explanatory sequential mixed methods design will be used, 
involving collecting quantitative data first and then 
explaining results with in-depth qualitative follow-up. 

In the first quantitative phase, _____ (instrument) data 
will be collected from _____ (participants) to test _____ 
(theory) to assess whether _____ (independent variables) 
relate to _____ (dependent variables). 

The second qualitative phase will help explain the 
quantitative results in more depth. The insight will _____ 
(provide detailed analysis/explain surprising findings).
```

---

## Mixed Methods Script: Exploratory Sequential

```
This study addresses _____ (overall intent). The purpose 
of this exploratory sequential design will be to first 
qualitatively explore with a small sample, design or 
modify a quantitative assessment based on qualitative 
findings, and then test this assessment with a large sample.

The first phase will qualitatively explore _____ (central 
phenomenon) with _____ (data types) from _____ 
(participants) at _____ (site). The qualitative findings 
will be used to design a cultural or context-specific 
quantitative assessment. The insight will be _____

## Mixed Methods Example: Convergent Design

**Classen et al. (2007)** - older driver safety:

> "This study provided an explicit socio-ecological view explaining the interrelation of possible causative factors, an integrated summary of these factors, and empirical guidelines for developing public health interventions to promote older driver safety. Using a mixed methods approach, we were able to compare and integrate main findings from a national crash dataset with perspectives of stakeholders."

**Analysis:**
- **Integration**: Compared national data with stakeholder perspectives
- **Both data types**: Quantitative crash data + qualitative stakeholder views
- **Outcome**: Guidelines for interventions

---

## Mixed Methods Example: Explanatory Sequential

**Ivankova & Stick (2007)** - student persistence:

> "The purpose of this mixed methods sequential explanatory study was to identify factors contributing to students' persistence in the ELHE program by obtaining quantitative results from a survey of 278 current and former students and then following up with four purposefully selected individuals to explore those results in more depth through a qualitative case study analysis."

**Analysis:**
- **Phase 1**: Quantitative survey (278 students)
- **Phase 2**: Qualitative case studies (4 individuals)  
- **Purpose**: Explore quantitative results in more depth
- **Mixed language**: "identify" (quantitative) + "explore" (qualitative)

---

### Writing Tips
- **Set apart** as separate section
- Use **appropriate scripts** as starting points
- Include **all required components**
- **Define key terms** for reader understanding

---

## Summary

The purpose statement establishes the **intent of the entire research study**:

- **Qualitative** purpose statements contain information about the central phenomenon, participants, and research site
- **Quantitative** purpose statements focus on relating or comparing variables and include theory, participants, and research site  
- **Mixed methods** purpose statements indicate overall intent, design type, both quantitative and qualitative elements, and integration rationale

**Remember**: The purpose statement is the **foundation** that guides all other aspects of your research design!

# Research Design: The Logic of Inference

.footnote[King, G., Keohane, R. O., & Verba, S. (1994). *Designing social inquiry scientific inference in qualitative research*. Princeton University Press.]

---

## Core Argument

### One Logic, Two Styles
- **Main Goal**: Connect "quantitative" and "qualitative" research traditions through a **unified logic of inference**
- **Key Insight**: Differences between approaches are mainly **stylistic and technical**, not methodological
- **Foundation**: Same underlying logic provides framework for **both** research approaches

### The False Dichotomy
- Quantitative researchers: "Only statistical analysis leads to truth"
- Qualitative researchers: "Statistical analyses are irrelevant"
- **Reality**: Both approaches follow the **same fundamental principles** of scientific inference

---

## Two Research Styles Defined

### Quantitative Research Characteristics
- Uses **numbers and statistical methods**
- Based on **numerical measurements** of specific phenomena
- **Abstracts** from particular instances to seek general descriptions
- Tests **causal hypotheses**
- Seeks **easily replicable** measurements and analyses

### Qualitative Research Characteristics
- Focuses on **particular instances** often important in their own right
- Analyzes events **closely and in full detail**
- Emphasizes **rich textual and contextual understanding**
- Studies major changes, elections, decisions, or crises
- Often linked to **area studies** and specific cultural contexts

---

## The Integration Imperative

### Why Both Approaches Are Necessary

**Real-world complexity requires both:**
- Some data amenable to **statistical analysis**
- Other equally significant information that **cannot be quantified**
- **Patterns and trends** vs. **flow of ideas** and **individual leadership**

### Successful Examples
- **Lisa Martin** (1992): 99 quantitative cases + 6 detailed case studies of economic sanctions
- **Robert Putnam** (1993): Large-scale surveys + detailed case studies of 6 Italian regions
- **Lesson**: Neither approach alone is sufficient for comprehensive understanding


---

## Defining Scientific Research

### Four Essential Characteristics

Scientific research must have **all four** characteristics:

1. **The goal is inference** - Make descriptive or explanatory inferences beyond particular observations
2. **The procedures are public** - Use explicit, codified methods that can be assessed and replicated
3. **The conclusions are uncertain** - Acknowledge that inference is inherently imperfect
4. **The content is the method** - Focus on methods and rules, not just subject matter

---

## Characteristic 1: The Goal is Inference

### Beyond Description
- **Descriptive inference**: Characterize unobserved phenomena based on observed data
- **Causal inference**: Learn about causal effects from data we observe
- **Key principle**: Must go **beyond particular observations** collected

### Examples
- Using **small sample** to infer about larger population
- Learning about **contemporary behavior** from historical data  
- Understanding **general patterns** from specific cases
- **Distinguishing mark**: Making inferences that **extend beyond** immediate observations

---

## Characteristic 2: Procedures Are Public

### Explicit and Replicable Methods
> "The sociological analysis of qualitative data often resides in a private world of penetrating but unfathomable insights... However, science is **public, not private**." - Robert K. Merton

### Requirements for Public Procedures
- **Codified methods** that can be assessed for reliability
- **Explicit rules** of research procedure and inference
- **Teachable and shareable** approaches
- Ability to **evaluate principles of selection** and **logic of conclusions**

---

### Consequence
- Methods have **limitations** - but these can be **understood and addressed**
- Results can be **compared across researchers**
- Studies can be **replicated**
- Scholars can **learn** from each other's methods

---

## Characteristic 3: Conclusions Are Uncertain

### Embracing Imperfection
- **Inference is inherently imperfect** - we use data to learn about the world that produced it
- **Perfect certainty impossible** - this would be tautology, not science
- **Honest reporting** of uncertainty levels is essential
- **Limited information** often necessary feature of social inquiry

### Practical Implications
- **Urgency vs. perfection**: Social world changes rapidly
- **Better to act** on imperfect information than wait for perfect data
- **Uncertainty acknowledgment** makes research more valuable, not less
- **Goal**: Disciplined thought, not dogma

---

## Characteristic 4: Content Is the Method

### Method Over Subject Matter
> "The unity of all science consists alone in its **method, not in its material**." - Karl Pearson (1892)

### Implications
- **Same methods** can study virtually anything
- **Science as social enterprise** - mistakes caught by community
- **Individual limitations** overcome through collective scrutiny
- **Contribution value** - even minor work advances field if methodologically sound

---

### Liberation
- Work need **not be perfect** to make important contribution
- **Community correction** improves overall knowledge
- **Public methods** more valuable than private insights
