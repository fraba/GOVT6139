### General principles of good writing (not specific to this course)

.pull-left[

### Suggestions

- Start with a plan
- Organise using subheadings
- Organise ideas into paragraphs
- Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence ‚Äì that summarises the main idea of that paragraph
- Communicate clearly
- Use active voice
- Assume an educated, but non- specialist audience.

]

.pull-right[

### Things to avoid

- Overly long paragraphs
- Less common ‚Äì overly short paragraphs
- Overly long sentences
- Overuse of passive voice
- Overuse of quotes
    - Use quotes selectively
    - Usually better to paraphrase
- Plagiarism
    - Quotes need both a citation and quotation marks
    - University policies treat accidental and intentional plagiarism the same

# Variables

---

## Recap: Variables (I)

> A variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed that may assume more than one of a set of values to which a **numerical measure** or a **category** from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, weight, etc., and ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù, ‚Äúindustry‚Äù, ‚Äúdisease‚Äù, etc.)

OECD https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2857

---

## Recap: Variables (II)

*An attribute that can take on a range of values (e.g. for individuals: education level, age, gender; for countries; type of political regime, economic performance)*

- **Independent variable** (the presumed cause)
- **Dependent variable** (the presumed effect)
- **Control variables** (any other variables that may be expected to influence the dependent variable)

.center[<mark>The effect of $X$ (independent variable) on $Y$ (dependent variable), controlling for $Z$ (control variable(s))</mark>]

$$ Y = X + Z $$

### Examples: What is the independent variable and dependent variable?

- What effect does education have on political participation?

- What effect does social media use have on trust in government?

- What effect do gender quotas have on the proportion of women in parliament?


---

## Variables and measurement

Depending on how variables are measured, they can be one of three types:

1. **Nominal variable** (categorical): no hierarchy (e.g. religion, sex)

    * **Dichotomous variable**: Type of nominal variable where there are only two values (e.g. whether voted / sex)
    
2. **Ordinal variable** (categorical): some hierarchy (e.g. income group, level of education, regime type)

3. **Interval variable** (continuous): (e.g. age, income)

**Note**: 

* These categorizations here refer to the way the variable is measured; but ...

* whereas the distinction between independent and dependent variables refers to their role in the hypothesis

---

### Questions for you: What type of variables are these (nominal, ordinal or interval)?

(Answer on Menti: https://www.menti.com/alf6dubihfkj)

#### Satisfaction with democracy:

> On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with the way democracy works in Australia? Response categories [Very satisfied; fairly satisfied; not very satisfied; not at all satisfied]


#### Leader popularity:

> Using a scale from 0 to 10, please show how much you like or dislike the party leaders. If you don't know much about them, you should give them a rating of 5.

#### Vote:

> In the Federal election for the House of Representatives on Saturday 18 May, which party did you vote for first in the House of Representatives? Response categories [Liberal; Labor; National; Greens; Other; Did not vote]

# Univariate analysis

---

## Univariate Analysis (One Variable)

### Ways to analyze

- Mean (the average)
- Other measures of central tendency - median and mode
- Distribution of responses (e.g. can look at percentage who ‚Äòagree‚Äô or ‚Äòdisagree‚Äô to an item)

### How to present

- Tables
- Graphs ‚Äì e.g. bar graph, pie chart

###Example findings

- 25% of Australians think that people in government can be trusted.
- On average Australians rated Scott Morrison at 5.1 on a scale from 0-10 of how much they liked the leader

---

### Univariate Analysis: Example table Approval of leadership changes, 2010-2015

*Australian Election Study* 

Question wording: 

> 2019: Do you approve or disapprove of the way the Liberal Party handled the leadership change in August of last year, when Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull? [strongly approve, approve, disapprove, strongly disapprove] (Similar questions in 2010, 2013 and 2016)

|                                                       |     Approve (%)    |     Disapprove (%)    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
|     2010: Julia Gillard replaced Kevin Rudd           |     26             |     74                |
|     2013: Kevin Rudd replaced Julia Gillard           |     42             |     58                |
|     2015: Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott       |     49             |     51                |
|     2018: Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull    |     26             |     74                |

## Univariate Analysis: Example Satisfaction with democracy

*Australian Election Study* 

Question wording:

> On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all satisfied with the way democracy works in Australia? (2019 survey responses)

|     Very satisfied            |     8%      |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
|     Fairly satisfied          |     51%     |
|     Not very satisfied        |     29%     |
|     Not   at all satisfied    |     12%     |
|     Total                     |     100%    |

# Bivariate analysis

---

## Bivariate Analysis (Two variables)

### Looking at the relationship between two variables 

### Different kinds of variables ‚Äì different analyses

- If you have two categorical variables (nominal variables, ordinal variables) ‚Äì **tables, bar graphs**

- If you have two interval (continuous) variables ‚Äì **scatterplots**

- If you have one categorical variable (nominal / ordinal) and one interval variable ‚Äì **group means, line graph**

## Bivariate Analysis (Two variables)

### Relationships between two continuous variables

- A variable is *related* or *unrelated* to another

- A variable is *positively* or *negatively* related to another

- A variable is *strongly* or *weakly* related to another

- A variable has a *large* of *small* effect on another

- A variable is *significantly* or *insignificantly* related to another

---

## Bivariate Analysis (Two variables)

### Relationships between two interval (continuous) variables

- The **correlation coefficient** (or $r$) measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables on a scatterplot.

- A complete lack of relationship: $r = 0$

- A completely negative relationship: $r = -1$

- A completely positive relationship: $r = 1$

- Some positive relationship: $0 < r < 1$

- Some negative relationship: $-1 < r < 0$
