## Acknowledgement of Country

I would like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of Australia and  recognise their continuing connection to land, water and culture. The  University of Sydney is located on the land of the Gadigal people  of the Eora Nation. I pay my respects to their Elders, past and present.

## Your teacher
	
Francesco Bailo (francesco.bailo@sydney.edu.au)

I am a Lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sydney. I am interested in researching forms of political engagement and political talk on social media. I researched the emergence and dynamics of online communities, the role between news organisations and social media, and the interdependence between social media activists and news organisations. I have engaged with and applied quantitative research methods developing expertise in quantitative text analysis (NLP) and network analysis.

This year I am teaching GOVT6139 and SSPS4102.

Fun fact: I took GOVT6139 in 2014 during my PhD.

# Some tips


* Ask questions sooner than later, and ask questions at any point.

--

* All seminar slides are available from Canvas (go to "Modules") by the beginning of the seminar, so keep them open on your laptop (this makes opening links much easier).

.center[&lt;img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/pNpONEEg3pLIQ/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## How are seminars run?

Mix of 

- Lectures;

- Discussions (including on readings): Discussions will generally be prompted by questions you will be required to answer through Canvas and Mentimeter (you will try this soon!);

- Group work;

- Data labs (in Week 10 and 11).

## Expectations

- Attend class in-person or (only if authorised by the universit) via Zoom.

- Do the readings before coming to class.

- Come to class prepared to contribute to the discussion and share reflections on the readings.

## What do we mean by Research Design?

A class focused on how research in the social sciences is conducted.

Key questions:

* What is *knowledge*? *How* do we know? And *what* we know and what can we know?

* How do we critically evaluate research?

* How do we do research and conduct our research processes?

.pull-right[&lt;img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieUe6ejxSFxYCXe/giphy.gif' width = '90%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## Can we trust research (in the social sciences)?

– Not a matter of research can / cannot be trusted

– Every study has strengths and weaknesses

– Different types of studies have different knowledge claims (interpretivism vs positivism)

– Many areas are debated: e.g. economic conditions and protest

– Research results specific to the context in which they were studied

– Knowledge a cumulative endeavor (meta-analyses / systematic reviews)

– Surveys: All depends on how the survey was conducted

---

## This semester is about unpacking ...

1. What is **knowledge** (in the social and political sciences) and

2. How is it **generated**?

.center[&lt;img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIP9cJEOO9ljKoCc/giphy.gif" width = "50%"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

---

## Why to take this class? (1/2)


### Understand the processes by which research is conducted in the social sciences.

So what?

– Become a critical consumer of research

– Build a foundation to be able to conduct social science research

– Real world relevance, e.g. understand how survey research is conducted and whether it can be trusted

– Understand strengths and weaknesses of different research approaches e.g. interviews vs surveys

– Understand new frontiers on methods

– Evidence-based policy making

– Professionally relevant skills

---

## Why to take this class? (2/2)

### What the class is

– Broad introduction to research design and methods

– Both qualitative and quantitative approaches

– Opportunity to develop a research proposal

– Foundation for future research (e.g. Masters / PhD / work settings)

### What the class is not 

– An advanced statistics course (although we will do some #Rstat in week 10 &amp; 11)

– Opportunity to conduct a research project

– Note there are specialist qualitative / quantitative methods classes also on offer

## What is research? What is research design? And what do we mean by research methods?

Let's take this chocolate study...

.center[&lt;img src = '/Users/fbai9728/Documents/GitHub/GOVT6139/img/chocolate-study.png' width = '60%'&gt;&lt;/img&gt;]

Youmans, R. J., &amp; Jee, B. D. (2007). Fudging the numbers: Distributing chocolate influences student evaluations of an undergraduate course. *Teaching of Psychology*, 34(4), 245–247. https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

---

https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

Let's skim through the paper (is very short!) 

Then answer these questions: 

1. What *knowledge* is produced by the paper?

2. How was that *knowledge* produced? That is, how was the research *designed*?

3. How much do you *trust* this knowledge? 

4. And why? 

---

## How to contribute you answers

1. Enter your answers in Canvas

Then, 

2. Copy/paste them into Menti =&gt; https://www.menti.com/al8jn8dsxbqa

## My own research 

### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

.center[
&lt;img src = "../img/bailo-research-lines.png" height=350px /&gt;
]

### 2. Impacts of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

---

#### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

* Cross-disciplinary research: Digital ethnography, Computer science and Political science. 
* Loops involving Qualitative, Quantitative &amp; Computational methods.

##### Key research questions

* What opinions do **emerge** online, but also when and where?

* How do opinions **interact** with other opinions through the Cloud and its online communities?

* What factors determine the speed and reach of the **diffusion** of opinions? 

---
  
#### 2. Impact of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

* Political science research: Parties, Movements, Campaigns and Elections.
* Qualitative, Quantitative &amp; Computational methods.

##### Key research questions

* Can "Internet capital" offset a lack of social capital in facilitating participation and organisation?

* Does Internet capital facilitate the organisation of political discontent from the margin (low-social capital areas)?

* Do Internet technologies and services create more political instability by facilitating the emergence of new political actors (individuals or organisations)?
  
* Do social media negatively affect the quality of political deliberation? What factors, technologies or services are important in reducing the quality of online conversation?

## Reflection: Experiences of engaging with research

In groups, introduce yourself, and discuss briefly (5 mins):

- A situation where you had to deal with questions of research methods

- E.g. in your studies, or in your work, or understanding reporting in the media

- What challenges did you face?

- What questions do you have about the process of how research is conducted?

Prepare to share your ideas with the class by creating a document (Word or PPT in Teams =&gt; "Week 01")!
