# Part I: Writing the Proposal

---

## Introduction: Why Structure Matters

Before writing a proposal for a research study, consider:

- **General structure** or outline of topics and their order
- **Format differences** between quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods projects
- **Good writing practices** that ensure consistency and readability
- **Ethical practices** that affect all phases of the study

.content-box-green[

*A well-structured proposal provides a cohesive picture of your entire research project*

]

---

# Topics Presented in a Proposal

## Arguments presented in a proposal

* Consider early on in planning the study

  * The **major points** that need to be addressed
  
  * How they will convey a **cohesive picture** of the study
  
  * What the **core arguments** to advance are

---

## Nine Core Arguments for Any Proposal

**Maxwell's (2013) Essential Questions:**

1. What do readers need to **better understand** your topic?
2. What do readers **already know** about your topic?
3. What do you **propose to study**?
4. What is the **setting and participants**?
5. What **methods** will you use to collect data?
6. How will you **analyse** the data?
7. How will you **validate** your findings?
8. What **ethical issues** will your study present?
9. What do **preliminary results** show about feasibility and value?

*These nine questions provide the foundation for good research*

# Let's a few examples of proposal formats

---

## Qualitative Proposal Format: Constructivist/Interpretivist

**Introduction**
- Statement of the Problem (literature, deficiencies, relevance)
- Purpose of the Study
- Research Questions
- Philosophical Assumptions/Worldview and Theory

**Procedures**
- Qualitative Design (ethnography, case study, etc.)
- Role of the Researcher
- Data Collection Procedures
- Data Analysis Procedures
- Proposed Narrative Structure
- Strategies for Validation
- Anticipated Ethical Issues
- Preliminary Pilot Findings

**Appendixes**: Interview protocols, timeline, budget, chapter summaries

---

## Qualitative Proposal Format: Participatory/Social Justice

**Key Differences from Constructivist Format:**

- **Social Justice Theory** section (major elements, past use, applicability)
- **Collaborative data collection** approaches with participants
- **Transformative changes** likely to occur from the research
- Emphasis on **community involvement** and **participant empowerment**

*This format specifically identifies frameworks for addressing oppression, discrimination, and community involvement*

---

# Part II: Writing Strategies

---

## The Writing Process: Three Key Principles

### 1. Write Ideas Down Early
- **Visualise the final product** by getting words on paper
- **Advisors/Peers react better** to written ideas than verbal discussions
- **Draft a 1-2 page overview** before the full proposal
- Include: research problem, purpose, questions, data sources, significance (This will basically be Task 1 + 2!)

### 2. Work Through Multiple Drafts (This is way you want to submit a full draft for Task 3)
- **Iterative process**: write, review, rewrite
- **Elbow's method**: Write four 15-minute drafts rather than one polished hour
- **Don't polish too early** - focus on content first

---

### 3. Franklin's Three-Stage Model
1. **Develop an outline** (sentence, word, or visual map)
2. **Write and shift** ideas (move paragraphs around)
3. **Edit and polish** each sentence

---

## The Habit of Writing

**Establish Regular Writing Discipline:**

- **Write daily** or engage in thinking/collecting information daily
- **Chart your activities** for a week to find writing time
- **Select a consistent time** and place free of distractions
- **Write when fresh** - avoid weekend-only writing
- **Write in small, regular amounts** - avoid binge writing
- **Set specific, manageable tasks** for each session

**Track Your Progress:**
- Time spent writing
- Page equivalents finished
- Percentage of planned task completed

.center[**Share with supportive, constructive friends** until ready to go public]

---

## Clear and Concise Writing: Consistency

**Use Consistent Terms Throughout:**

- **Quantitative studies**: Same variable names throughout
- **Qualitative research**: Same name for central phenomena
- **Avoid synonyms** that confuse readers and cause them to question subtle meaning shifts

**Example Problem:**
"Students' academic performance" ‚Üí "learner achievement" ‚Üí "educational outcomes"

**Better Approach:**
Choose "academic performance" and use consistently throughout

---

## Narrative Structure: Four Types of Thoughts

**Tarshis's (1982) Framework:**

1. **Umbrella Thoughts**: General or core ideas you're conveying (this is likely your core argument)
2. **Big Thoughts**: Specific ideas that reinforce, clarify, or elaborate umbrella thoughts
3. **Little Thoughts**: Ideas whose function is to reinforce big thoughts
4. **Attention/Interest Thoughts**: Ideas that keep readers on track and organize content

**Common Problems:**
- Too many umbrella ideas without sufficient detail
- Short, unconnected paragraphs (newspaper style)
- Missing organisational statements that guide readers

.footnote[Tarshis, B. (1982). *How to write like a pro: A guide to effective nonfiction writing*. New American Library.]

.small[
(1) Despite widespread recognition of climate change as a global challenge, policy implementation at the national level remains inconsistent and inadequate. (2) This implementation gap is particularly evident in three key areas. (3) First, renewable energy adoption rates vary dramatically between developed nations, with some countries achieving over 40% renewable electricity while others lag below 10%. (4) These disparities reflect differences in government incentives, grid infrastructure capacity, and public-private partnerships. (5) Second, carbon pricing mechanisms, while adopted by 46 national jurisdictions, show significant variation in coverage and price levels. (6) For instance, carbon prices range from less than $1 per tonne in some systems to over $130 per tonne in others, undermining global coordination efforts. (7) Finally, international climate finance commitments consistently fall short of pledged amounts. (8) The $100 billion annual pledge to developing countries remains unmet, with actual contributions reaching only $83.3 billion in 2020. (9) Understanding these implementation challenges is crucial for developing more effective climate governance frameworks.

### What is what?

1. **Umbrella Thoughts**: General or core ideas you're conveying (this is likely your core argument)
2. **Big Thoughts**: Specific ideas that reinforce, clarify, or elaborate umbrella thoughts
3. **Little Thoughts**: Ideas whose function is to reinforce big thoughts
4. **Attention/Interest Thoughts**: Ideas that keep readers on track and organize content



---

## Coherence in Writing

**Definition**: Ideas tie together, flow logically from sentence to sentence, and connect from paragraph to paragraph

**Strategies for Coherence:**
- **Repeat key terms** in title, purpose, questions, literature headings
- **Maintain consistent order** for presenting variables
- **Use transitional words** and connecting phrases
- **Apply the hook-and-eye exercise**: Circle key ideas and connect sentences/paragraphs

**Zinsser's Rule**: Every sentence should be a logical sequel to the one that preceded it

---

## Hook-and-Eye Exercise Example

**Process:**
1. Circle key ideas ("eyes") in each sentence
2. Connect related ideas with lines ("hooks")
3. Good connections = coherence
4. Difficult connections = need for transitional words/phrases

# Part III: Voice, Tense, and Style

---

## Voice, Tense, and "Fat"

**Active vs. Passive Voice:**
- **Use active voice** whenever possible
- **Active**: "The researchers conducted interviews". 
  - But you can also say, "I/we conducted..." Your subjectivity might count!
- **Passive**: "Interviews were conducted by the researchers"
- **Passive indicators**: was, will be, have been, is being

**Strong Verbs:**
- Avoid "lazy verbs" (is, was, to be verbs)
- Choose action-oriented, specific verbs
- Replace verb + adjective combinations with strong verbs

---

## Verb Tense Guidelines (APA Recommendations)

**Past Tense or Present Perfect:**
- Literature reviews: "Smith (2020) found..." or "Researchers have shown..."
- Procedures based on past events

**Past Tense:**
- Describing results: "Stress lowered self-esteem"

**Present Tense:**
- Discussing findings and conclusions: "The findings show..."

**Future Tense:**
- Proposals describing planned research: "This study will examine..."

---

## Trimming the "Fat"

**"Fat" = Unnecessary words that don't convey meaning**

**Common Fat to Remove:**
- **Piled-up modifiers**: "very unique and extremely important"
- **Excessive prepositions**: "in order to," "with regard to"
- **"The-of" constructions**: "the study of the impact of..."
- **Overused phrases**: "it should be noted that," "needless to say"
- **Excessive quotations, italics, parenthetical comments**

**Wolcott's Editorial Skills:**
- Keep only essential words
- Use active voice
- Scale down qualifiers (maximum one per concept)
- Strike out overused phrases completely

# Ethical Issues

* Research involves collecting data from people

* Researchers need to

  1. Protect research participants
  2. Develop trust with research participants
  3. Promote the integrity of research
  4. Guard against misconduct
  5. Cope with new problems that emerge

---

## Prior to beginning the study:

* Consider codes of ethics

* Apply to the institutional review board (in Australia: Human Research Ethics Committees)

* Obtain the necessary permissions to gain access to the site and to study participants

* Select a site without vested interests

* Negotiate authorship for publication

---

## Beginning the study:

* .content-box-yellow[In the research problem]:
  * Identify a problem that will benefit individuals being studied
