## Your teacher
	
Francesco Bailo (francesco.bailo@sydney.edu.au)

I am a Lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sydney. I am interested in researching forms of political engagement and political talk on social media. I researched the emergence and dynamics of online communities, the role between news organisations and social media, and the interdependence between social media activists and news organisations. I have engaged with and applied quantitative research methods developing expertise in quantitative text analysis (NLP) and network analysis.

This year I am teaching GOVT6139, SSPS4102 & SSPS6006.

Fun fact: I took GOVT6139 in 2014 during my PhD.

# Let's get started with Research methods...

---

# Some preliminary tips


* Ask questions sooner than later, and ask questions at any point.

--

* All seminar slides are available from Canvas (go to "Modules") by the beginning of the seminar, so keep them open on your laptop (this makes opening links much easier).

--

---

## How are seminars run?

Mix of 

- Lectures (with four confirmed guest speakers);

- Discussions (including on readings): Discussions will generally be prompted by questions you will be required to answer through Mentimeter or Padlet;

- Individual and group tasks (with a focus on writing for research);

- Literature Lab in Week 3 and Data lab with R and RStudio in Week 10 (make sure to bring your laptop to class then)

---

## My expectations

- Attend class in-person (the expectation is that you will attend at least 90% of classes).

- Read the textbook chapter assigned for that week before coming to class and come to class prepared to contribute to the discussion and share reflections on the readings.

# An overview

---

## What do we mean by Research Design?

A class focused on how research in the social sciences is conducted.

Key questions:

* What is *knowledge*? *How* do we know? And *what* we know and what can we know?

* How do we critically evaluate research?

* How do we do research and conduct our research processes?

.pull-right[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieUe6ejxSFxYCXe/giphy.gif' width = '90%'></img>]

---

## Can we trust research (in the social sciences)?

- Not a matter of research can / cannot be trusted

- Every study has strengths and weaknesses

- Different types of studies have different knowledge claims (interpretivism vs positivism)

- Many areas are debated: e.g. economic conditions and protest

- Research results specific to the context in which they were studied

- Knowledge a cumulative endeavor (meta-analyses / systematic reviews)

- Surveys: All depends on how the survey was conducted

---

## This semester is about unpacking ...

1. What is **knowledge** (in the social and political sciences) and

2. How is it **generated**?

.center[<img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIP9cJEOO9ljKoCc/giphy.gif" width = "50%"></img>]

---

## Why to take this class? (1/2)


### Understand the processes by which research is conducted in the social sciences.

So what?

- Become a critical consumer of research

- Build a foundation to be able to conduct social science research

- Real world relevance, e.g. understand how survey research is conducted and whether it can be trusted

- Understand strengths and weaknesses of different research approaches e.g. interviews vs surveys

- Understand new frontiers on methods

- Evidence-based policy making

- Professionally relevant skills

---

## Why to take this class? (2/2)

### What the class is

- Broad introduction to research design and methods

- Both qualitative and quantitative approaches

- Opportunity to develop a research proposal

- Foundation for future research (e.g. Masters / PhD / work settings)

### What the class is not 

- An advanced statistics course (Will do some #Rstat in week 10 but you should consider [Data Analytics for Social Research SSPS6006](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2024/ssps/ssps6006.html) for a dedicated unit)

- Opportunity to conduct a research project

- Note there are specialist qualitative / quantitative methods classes also on offer

# A quick excercise on research and knowledge

---

## What is research? What is research design? And what do we mean by research methods?

Let's take this chocolate study...

.center[<img src = '../img/chocolate-study.png' width = '60%'></img>]

Youmans, R. J., & Jee, B. D. (2007). Fudging the numbers: Distributing chocolate influences student evaluations of an undergraduate course. *Teaching of Psychology*, 34(4), 245â€“247. https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

---

https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

Let's skim through the paper (is very short!) 

Then answer these questions: 

1. What *knowledge* is produced by the paper?

2. How was that *knowledge* produced? That is, how was the research *designed*?

3. How much do you *trust* this knowledge? 

4. And why? 

**Add your answers into Menti** (same as before: https://www.menti.com/alxf5iwcwtzu)

# Something about my own research 

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/MqE9IzBsmmShq/giphy.gif'></img>

---

### What do I study?

### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

.center[
<img src = "../img/bailo-research-lines.png" height=350px />
]

### 2. Impacts of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

---

## 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

* Cross-disciplinary research: Digital ethnography, Computer science and Political science. 
* Loops involving Qualitative, Quantitative & Computational methods.

### Key research questions

* What opinions do **emerge** online, but also when and where?

* How do opinions **interact** with other opinions through the Cloud and its online communities?

* What factors determine the speed and reach of the **diffusion** of opinions? 

---
  
## 2. Impact of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

* Political science research: Parties, Movements, Campaigns and Elections.
* Qualitative, Quantitative & Computational methods.

### Key research questions

* Can "Internet capital" offset a lack of social capital in facilitating participation and organisation?

* Does Internet capital facilitate the organisation of political discontent from the margin (low-social capital areas)?

* Do Internet technologies and services create more political instability by facilitating the emergence of new political actors (individuals or organisations)?
  
* Do social media negatively affect the quality of political deliberation? What factors, technologies or services are important in reducing the quality of online conversation?

# Reflection

---

## Group task: Experiences of engaging with research

In groups, introduce yourself, and discuss briefly (5 mins):

- A situation where you had to deal with questions of research methods

    - E.g. in your studies, or in your work, or understanding reporting in the media

- What challenges did you face?

- What questions do you have about the process of how research is conducted?

After discussing, share your individually or as group on Padlet (next slide...)

# Tools

---

## Let's talk about... tools! (1/2)

* You need a **reference management software**. And you need it now!

    * If you are not using one yet I suggest you install Zotero (+ browser plugin, + Word plugin). Other popular option is EndNote. What RMS are you using? 
  
.center[<img src ='../img/menti-week-01.png' width = '30%'></img> 

or https://www.menti.com/al8jn8dsxbqa]

---

## Let's talk about... tools! (2/2)

* Familiarise yourself with **search tools** for academic works (in A2 you will need to produce a literature review): start with thr *library website*, *Google Scholar*, and *Research Rabbit* (https://researchrabbitapp.com/home). 

.center[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/YGlRW1Am9q7e0/giphy.gif'></img>]

Remember that a good literature review aims for *relevance* more than *completeness* (simply, you can't win the completeness battle!). As you keep accumulating interesting works, keep asking yourself: why are these relevant? How does this support my own research project?

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT (1/4)


.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/ChatGPT_logo.svg' width = '20%'></img>]


### Do you use it and how?

.center[<img src ='../img/menti-week-01.png' width = '30%'></img> 

or https://www.menti.com/al8jn8dsxbqa]

---

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT (2/4)

### Should I use it? 

.center[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JhNkxsr2EtjfXwY/giphy.gif' width ='35%'></img>]

Definitely!

### Problem is how to use it!

No need to say that the wrong way to use it is copying/pasting ChatGPT answers into your *original* work. 

This is not only cheating but also ChatGPT will never produce *original* (that is, *creative*) work!

---

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT (3/4)

### What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a *chatbot* build on a very sophisticated *language model* trained on one of the most comprehensive corpus of texts ever assembled in the history on our human civilisation.

### What does it do in practice? 

.pull-left[

Given an input, ChatGPT will guess the *best* possible series of words to respond to that input. In doing so, it simulate a person that is not only very knowledgeable on the topic but also naturally competent in the English language.

---

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT (4/4)

### How does it do in practice?

One of the best way to understand the working of any language model available in 2023 is to think about *compression algorithms*.


### How do compression algorithms work? 

* First excluding some information and 

* second interpolating information to fill gaps. 

ChatGPT is for written information what JPEG is for images. Interpolation is what gives the impression of creative knowledge. **In conclusions**, ChatGPT output can be helpful to find new information (e.g. a paper?) but can't be trusted at face value! 


See: *ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web* by Ted Chiang  (https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web)
