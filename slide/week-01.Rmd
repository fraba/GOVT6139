## Your teacher
	
Francesco Bailo (francesco.bailo@sydney.edu.au)

I am a Lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sydney. I am interested in researching forms of political engagement and political talk on social media. I researched the emergence and dynamics of online communities, the role between news organisations and social media, and the interdependence between social media activists and news organisations. I have engaged with and applied quantitative research methods developing expertise in quantitative text analysis (NLP) and network analysis.

This year I am teaching GOVT6139, SSPS4102 & SSPS6006.

Fun fact: I took GOVT6139 in 2014 during my PhD.

# Let's get started with Research methods...

---

# Some preliminary tips


* Ask questions sooner than later, and ask questions at any point.

--

* All seminar slides are available from Canvas (go to "Modules") by the beginning of the seminar, so keep them open on your laptop (this makes opening links much easier).

---

## How are seminars run?

Mix of 

- Lectures: 

    * on the content covered by textbook and;
    
    * about the practice of research design (also with four guest lectures)

- Discussions (including on readings): Discussions will generally be prompted by questions and answers socialised using Menti and Padlet (this would require you come to class with an Internet connected device) 

- Individual and group tasks with a focus on research design and research writing;

- Literature Lab in Week 3 and Data lab (with R and RStudio) in Week 10 (make sure to bring your laptop to class then)

---

## My expectations

- Get your own copy of the textbook: Creswell, J. W., & Creswell, J. D. (2022 or 2018). *Research design qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches* (Sixth or Fifth edition). SAGE.

- Read the textbook chapter assigned each week before coming to class and come to class prepared to contribute to the discussion and share reflections on the readings.

- Attend and engage in class (the expectation is that you will attend at least 90% of classes).

## What some GOVT6139 students liked last year

(This is not intended to be a representative summary - just a summary of individual comments)

1. The course provides a structured guide for allocating attention to research proposal components, 

2. it includes peer reviews and in-class assignments that enrich learning, 

3. offers extensive related readings and valuable colleague feedback for constructing research designs, and 

4. allows flexibility in assignment topics within assessment criteria, enabling personalized exploration.

---

## What some GOVT6139 students had mixed feelings about last year

### Use of sharing tools such as Menti and Padlet.

* Some found that they enriched and supported the experience;

* Other found them laborious and repetitive after a while.

CLOSING THE LOOP: This year, we will use these tools less frequently and in a more targeted way (for context, last year GOVT6139 was offered in a hybrid mode.) 

---

## What some GOVT6139 students didn't like last year

(This is not intendend to be a representative summary - just a summary of individual comments)

1. The course needs to offer more practical exercises for writing proposals, including detailed guidance to enhance students' writing skills. 

2. The lack of timely feedback on in-class group activities due to time constraints makes it challenging for students to understand if they've correctly grasped the concepts. 

3. The assessment's weighting system is described as overly complex and confusing, leading to difficulties in understanding evaluation criteria.

4.  Readings were sometime not utilised in lectures, sometimes felt irrelevant to the course content, or were outdated.

---

## What some GOVT6139 students didn't like last year

CLOSING THE LOOP in 2024: 

1. We introduced a textbook which is very much focused on writing a research proposal and we will make sure to discuss that content in class. Guest lectures about practical research experience will complement that. 

2. We will give more time to in-class activities (including about research writing) and to provide in-class feedback on these activities. 

3. I published more resources on Canvas about tasks and weighting (but please, make sure you read them and ask questions if something is not clear)

# An overview

---

## What do we mean by Research Design?

A class focused on how research in the social sciences is conducted.

Key questions:

* What is *knowledge*? *How* do we know? And *what* we know and what can we know?

* How do we critically evaluate research?

* How do we do research and conduct our research processes?

.pull-right[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieUe6ejxSFxYCXe/giphy.gif' width = '90%'></img>]

---

## Can we trust research (in the social sciences)?

- Not a matter of research can / cannot be trusted

- Every study has strengths and weaknesses

- Different types of studies have different knowledge claims (interpretivism vs positivism)

- Many areas are debated: e.g. economic conditions and protest

- Research results specific to the context in which they were studied

- Knowledge a cumulative endeavor (meta-analyses / systematic reviews)

- Surveys: All depends on how the survey was conducted

---

## This semester is about unpacking ...

1. What is **knowledge** (in the social and political sciences) and

2. How is it **generated**?

.center[<img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIP9cJEOO9ljKoCc/giphy.gif" width = "50%"></img>]

---

## Why to take this class? (1/2)


### Understand the processes by which research is conducted in the social sciences.

So what?

- Become a critical consumer of research

- Build a foundation to be able to conduct social science research

- Real world relevance, e.g. understand how survey research is conducted and whether it can be trusted

- Understand strengths and weaknesses of different research approaches e.g. interviews vs surveys

- Understand new frontiers on methods

- Evidence-based policy making

- Professionally relevant skills

---

## Why to take this class? (2/2)

### What the class is

- Broad introduction to research design and methods

- Both qualitative and quantitative approaches

- Opportunity to develop a research proposal

- Foundation for future research (e.g. Masters / PhD / work settings)

### What the class is not 

- An advanced statistics course (Will do some #Rstat in week 10 but you should consider [Data Analytics for Social Research SSPS6006](https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/units-of-study/2024/ssps/ssps6006.html) for a dedicated unit)

- Opportunity to conduct a research project

# A quick excercise on research and knowledge

---

## What is research? What is research design? And what do we mean by research methods?

Let's take this chocolate study...

.center[<img src = '../img/chocolate-study.png' width = '60%'></img>]

Youmans, R. J., & Jee, B. D. (2007). Fudging the numbers: Distributing chocolate influences student evaluations of an undergraduate course. *Teaching of Psychology*, 34(4), 245–247. https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

---

https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

Let's skim through the paper (is very short!) 

Then answer these questions: 

1. What *knowledge* is produced by the paper?

2. How was that *knowledge* produced? That is, how was the research *designed*?

3. How much do you *trust* this knowledge? 

4. And why? 

**Add your answers into Menti** (same link as before)

# Something about my own research 

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/MqE9IzBsmmShq/giphy.gif'></img>

---

### What do I study?

### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

.center[
<img src = "../img/bailo-research-lines.png" height=320px />
]

### 2. Impacts of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

---

## 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

* Cross-disciplinary research: Digital ethnography, Computer science and Political science. 

* Loops involving Qualitative, Quantitative & Computational methods.

### Key research questions

* What opinions do **emerge** online, but also when and where?

* How do opinions **interact** with other opinions through the Cloud and its online communities?

* What factors determine the speed and reach of the **diffusion** of opinions? 

---
  
## 2. Impact of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

* Political science research: Parties, Movements, Campaigns and Elections.
* Qualitative, Quantitative & Computational methods.

### Key research questions

* Can "Internet capital" offset a lack of social capital in facilitating participation and organisation?

* Does Internet capital facilitate the organisation of political discontent from the margin (low-social capital areas)?

* Do Internet technologies and services create more political instability by facilitating the emergence of new political actors (individuals or organisations)?
  
* Do social media negatively affect the quality of political deliberation? What factors, technologies or services are important in reducing the quality of online conversation?

# Reflection

---

## Group task: Experiences of engaging with research

In groups, introduce yourself, and discuss briefly (5 mins):

1. A situation where you had to deal with questions of research methods

    - E.g. in your studies, or in your work, or understanding reporting in the media

2. What challenges did you face?

3. What questions do you have about the process of how research is conducted?

After discussing, share your answers about 2. and 3. as group on Padlet (next slide...)

# Tools

<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/l0G18BkChcRRctMZ2/giphy.gif' width = '50%'></img>

---

## Let's talk about... tools! (1/2)

* You need a **reference management software**. And you need it now!

    * If you are not using one yet I suggest you install Zotero (+ browser plugin, + Word plugin). Other popular option is EndNote. What RMS are you using? 
  
.center[<img src ='../img/menti-week-01.png' width = '30%'></img> 

or https://www.menti.com/al8jn8dsxbqa]

---

## Let's talk about... tools! (2/2)

* Familiarise yourself with **search tools** for academic works (in A2 you will need to produce a literature review): start with thr *library website*, *Google Scholar*, *Web of Science* or *Scopus*, and *Research Rabbit* (https://researchrabbitapp.com/home). 

.center[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/YGlRW1Am9q7e0/giphy.gif' width = '20%'></img>]

Remember that a good literature review aims for *relevance* more than *completeness* (simply, you can't win the completeness battle!). As you keep accumulating interesting works, keep asking yourself: why are these relevant? How does this support my own research project?

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT and GenAI (1/4)


.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/ChatGPT_logo.svg' width = '20%'></img>]


### Do you use it and how?

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT and GenAI (2/4)

### Should I use it? 

.center[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JhNkxsr2EtjfXwY/giphy.gif' width ='35%'></img>]

Definitely!

### Problem is how to use it!

No need to say that the wrong way to use it is copying/pasting ChatGPT answers into your *original* work. 

This is not only cheating but also ChatGPT will never produce *original* (that is, *creative*) work!

---

### Use of GenAI in GOVT6139

Let's check [this Canvas page](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/55191/pages/use-of-generative-ai-and-other-marvels?module_item_id=2228838)

---

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT (3/4)

### What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a *chatbot* build on a very sophisticated *language model* trained on one of the most comprehensive corpus of texts ever assembled in the history on our human civilisation.

### What does it do in practice? 

.pull-left[

Given an input, ChatGPT will guess the *best* possible series of words to respond to that input. In doing so, it simulate a person that is not only very knowledgeable on the topic but also naturally competent in the English language.   

]

.pull-right[

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/19OIUml06udBC/giphy.gif)

]

---

## Let's talk about... ChatGPT (4/4)

### How does it do in practice?

One of the best way to understand the working of any language model available in 2023 is to think about *compression algorithms*.


### How do compression algorithms work? 

* First excluding some information and 

* second interpolating information to fill gaps. 

ChatGPT is written information what JPEG is for images. Interpolation is what gives the impression of creative knowledge. **In conclusions**, ChatGPT output can be helpful to find new information (e.g. a paper?) but can't be trusted at face value! 


See: Ted Chiang's [ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) but also Domenic Denicola's [ChatGPT Is Not a Blurry JPEG of the Web. It's a Simulacrum.](https://blog.domenic.me/chatgpt-simulacrum/)
