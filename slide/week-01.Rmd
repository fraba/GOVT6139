## Your teacher
	
Francesco Bailo (francesco.bailo@sydney.edu.au)

I am a Lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sydney. I am interested in researching forms of political engagement and political talk on social media. I researched the emergence and dynamics of online communities, the role between news organisations and social media, and the interdependence between social media activists and news organisations. I have engaged with and applied quantitative research methods developing expertise in quantitative text analysis (NLP) and network analysis.

This year I am teaching GOVT6139 and SSPS4102.

Fun fact: I took GOVT6139 in 2014 during my PhD.

# Some tips


* Ask questions sooner than later, and ask questions at any point.

--

* All seminar slides are available from Canvas (go to "Modules") by the beginning of the seminar, so keep them open on your laptop (this makes opening links much easier).

## How are seminars run?

Mix of 

- Lectures;

- Discussions (including on readings): Discussions will generally be prompted by questions you will be required to answer through Canvas and Mentimeter (you will try this soon!);

- Group work;

- Data labs (in Week 10 and 11).

## Expectations

- Attend class in-person or (only if authorised by the universit) via Zoom.

- Do the readings before coming to class.

- Come to class prepared to contribute to the discussion and share reflections on the readings.

## What do we mean by Research Design?

A class focused on how research in the social sciences is conducted.

Key questions:

* What is *knowledge*? *How* do we know? And *what* we know and what can we know?

* How do we critically evaluate research?

* How do we do research and conduct our research processes?

.pull-right[<img src = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieUe6ejxSFxYCXe/giphy.gif' width = '90%'></img>]

---

## Can we trust research (in the social sciences)?

– Not a matter of research can / cannot be trusted

– Every study has strengths and weaknesses

– Different types of studies have different knowledge claims (interpretivism vs positivism)

– Many areas are debated: e.g. economic conditions and protest

– Research results specific to the context in which they were studied

– Knowledge a cumulative endeavor (meta-analyses / systematic reviews)

– Surveys: All depends on how the survey was conducted

---

## This semester is about unpacking ...

1. What is **knowledge** (in the social and political sciences) and

2. How is it **generated**?

---

## Why to take this class? (1/2)


### Understand the processes by which research is conducted in the social sciences.

So what?

– Become a critical consumer of research

– Build a foundation to be able to conduct social science research

– Real world relevance, e.g. understand how survey research is conducted and whether it can be trusted

– Understand strengths and weaknesses of different research approaches e.g. interviews vs surveys

– Understand new frontiers on methods

– Evidence-based policy making

– Professionally relevant skills

---

## Why to take this class? (2/2)

### What the class is

– Broad introduction to research design and methods

– Both qualitative and quantitative approaches

– Opportunity to develop a research proposal

– Foundation for future research (e.g. Masters / PhD / work settings)

### What the class is not 

– An advanced statistics course (although we will do some #Rstat in week 10 & 11)

– Opportunity to conduct a research project

– Note there are specialist qualitative / quantitative methods classes also on offer

## What is research? What is research design? And what do we mean by research methods?

Let's take this chocolate study...

.center[<img src = '/Users/fbai9728/Documents/GitHub/GOVT6139/img/chocolate-study.png' width = '60%'></img>]

Youmans, R. J., & Jee, B. D. (2007). Fudging the numbers: Distributing chocolate influences student evaluations of an undergraduate course. *Teaching of Psychology*, 34(4), 245–247. https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

---

https://doi.org/10.1080/00986280701700318

Let's skim through the paper (is very short!) 

Then answer these questions: 

1. What *knowledge* is produced by the paper?

2. How was that *knowledge* produced? That is, how was the research *designed*?

3. How much do you *trust* this knowledge? 

4. And why? 

---

## How to contribute you answers

1. Enter your answers in Canvas

Then, 

2. Copy/paste them into Menti => https://www.menti.com/al8jn8dsxbqa

## My own research 

### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

.center[
<img src = "../img/bailo-research-lines.png" height=350px />
]

### 2. Impacts of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

---

#### 1. Emergence, interaction, and diffusion of *political opinions* online

* Cross-disciplinary research: Digital ethnography, Computer science and Political science. 
* Loops involving Qualitative, Quantitative & Computational methods.

##### Key research questions

* What opinions do **emerge** online, but also when and where?

* How do opinions **interact** with other opinions through the Cloud and its online communities?

* What factors determine the speed and reach of the **diffusion** of opinions? 

---
  
#### 2. Impact of social media technologies and services on *political participation and organisation*

* Political science research: Parties, Movements, Campaigns and Elections.
* Qualitative, Quantitative & Computational methods.

##### Key research questions

* Can "Internet capital" offset a lack of social capital in facilitating participation and organisation?

* Does Internet capital facilitate the organisation of political discontent from the margin (low-social capital areas)?

* Do Internet technologies and services create more political instability by facilitating the emergence of new political actors (individuals or organisations)?
  
* Do social media negatively affect the quality of political deliberation? What factors, technologies or services are important in reducing the quality of online conversation?

## Reflection: Experiences of engaging with research

In groups, introduce yourself, and discuss briefly (5 mins):

- A situation where you had to deal with questions of research methods

- E.g. in your studies, or in your work, or understanding reporting in the media

- What challenges did you face?

- What questions do you have about the process of how research is conducted?

Prepare to share your ideas with the class by creating a document (Word or PPT in Teams => "Week 01")!
